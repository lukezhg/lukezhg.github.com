    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/27/reflection-on-groupwork-modeling</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have wrote several posts about modeling:<br/>
Such as <a href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/08/24/interaction-simulation-based-inquiry-activities/">Interactive simulation based inquiry activities</a><br/>
Look for more click <a href="http://zhangchunlei.com/tag/modeling/">here</a></p>

<p>But this time I would rather to think modeling from the groupwork perspective.</p>

<p>As a teacher, we should keep in mind that groupwork can only be flowers while big science ideas are the real fruits. The big flowers don&#8217;t guaranteed the fruits are big.</p>

<p>Groupwork tasks take times, so they must be well designed and organized. What do I mean by well designed? The groupwork should meet the following preconditions:<br/>
1.  It is highly realated with the science idea that student are going to learn.<br/>
2.  It is challenging enough that it can&#8217;t be done individually.<br/>
3.  It is reachable for students with their present knowledges and skills.<br/>
4.  It generates meaningful discussions and productive outcommings.</p>

<p>What do I mean by well organized? The teacher should do the following:<br/>
1.  Students&#8217; prior idea should be explored and addressed.<br/>
2.  Possiblely related science theories or ideas should be put on the table(eg by brainstorming).<br/>
3.  All group members should engaged actively and equally in the task.<br/>
4.  Communication and collaboration skills should be taught to make sure that a positive classroom norms and culture is formed just like the community of scientists.<br/>
5.  Competition can be used to save time and for fun.</p>

<p>To be expanded.</p>

    <updated>2013-09-24T22:30:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/24/japan-lesson-study</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I watched two vedios of Japan science teaching see my <a href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/08/19/timss-video-and-reflection-of-teaching-science-with-modeling/">previous post</a></p>

<p>Since then I tend to pay close attention to Japan science education including both teaching practice and teacher professional development. Tonight we talked about the lesson study in Japan and China, So googled Japan lesson study and found 2 interesting resources(attached at the end of this post).</p>

<p>I think the Japan lesson study sounds really good.</p>

<p>First, the lesson is designed and prepared by a team not a single teacher. This is different from China, where one teacher is reponsible for everything and under a great pressure. When a team prepare and co-design the lesson, teacher can really have more opportunities to learn from each other.</p>

<p>Second, the study is aiming to solve a problem or acheiving a special goal. It is not providing a common good lesson for other teachers to follow or comment. This goal-orantied study will make it more meaningful for teachers. It becomes easier for other teachers take a stand to think if they have acheived their goal or what would help.</p>

<p>Third, the team will spend 3-4 years on the same goal, they will design a long range plan to achieve it. They also refine their goal ever year. So it tend to be a continue systematic problem solving process with significant value in a special school context.</p>

<p>Fourth, the topics of discussion and reflection can cover a wide range of concerns, including content related issues(goal of unit and lesson, concepts, problem to focus on, students&#8217; solution and response), and pedagogical issues and behaviors issues, also education rationals and goals.</p>

    <link href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/24/co-teaching/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-24T15:53:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/24/co-teaching</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I attended a workshop about co-teaching and mentoring by Dr Dresden. Georgia is going to promote co-teaching in the future. This was a foundational workshop for mentor teachers, in which they could know about what is co-teaching, how it is different from traditional mentoring, what kinds of approaches can be used. This was the task of the morning session. In the afternoon mentoring session, teachers were divided into 3 groups to work out how to welcome your teacher candidates, stages of their concern, and scenarios playing and discussions.</p>

<p>I found it interesting to hear what the mentor teacher say. Although co-teaching sounds like a powerful idea to make the internships session more effective, there are still lots of barriers and problems to overcome and handle with. Mentors do need to know how to co-teach, why to co-teach, what to do, but this is not enough. Another important part is the collaboration and communication between each pieces. Well teacher candidates, university professors are in university system, while teacher mentors are in the middle school system, they have different responsibilities and roles, they have few chances to work together, they are all very busy and tend to draw back for lack of time or inconvinient reasons. You know what, it takes time and energy and wisdom to build trust relationships between them.</p>

<p>So in the afternoon session, communication skills are stressed. But I think it would be more helpful if supervisors and teacher candidates can show up and speak their voices. Well may be this will be done during the Pairs workshop.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>宝宝七个月了，母乳开始不够吃了，爸爸给你设计了下面的副食，别挑食哦！</p>

<p>早餐：稀粥加青菜末、蛋黄泥<br/>
顺便多煮一个土豆或者红薯（备用）</p>

<p>母乳：一次性加热到39度，否则容易破坏免疫蛋白活性。</p>

<p>午餐：猪肝泥、米粉、西红柿糊（或者苹果泥）  <br/>
西红柿糊做法：做法： 将西红柿放入开水，随即取出。 将西红柿去皮，去籽，其余部分捣碎成糊状即可。</p>

<p>晚餐：土豆泥（或者红薯，紫薯）、果汁<br/>
土豆泥做法：土豆洗净煮到透心，去皮，用汤匙捣成泥，温度适宜后即可小口喂食。<br/>
果汁需要用温开水稀释2倍（不要太甜）</p>

<p>加餐：磨牙棒<br/>
1.把馒头切成1厘米厚的片，放在锅里，不加油，烤至两面微微发黄，外皮略有一点硬度，里面松软就可以了。一方面，馒头不会卡着孩子，另一方面，他可以自己用手拿着吃，既增加了吃的趣味性，又练习了手眼协调能力。除了能磨牙，营养和味道也不错。
2.也可以用蔬菜做磨牙棒，帮助宝宝尽早熟悉蔬菜的味道。把胡萝卜、黄瓜、白萝卜等去皮，刻成各种形状，比如刻成小动物;也可以将水果条、菜茎直接拿给宝宝，既能咬，又能玩，妈妈还可以帮他认物、辨色。</p>

    <link href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/20/metaphors-for-teaching/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-20T23:18:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/20/metaphors-for-teaching</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Metaphors for teaching:</h3>

<p>A teacher is just like a cook. You can tell a good cook by the taste of his dishes, so you can also tell a good teacher by his students&#8217; acheivements. Sometimes you can also tell a good cook by observing his cooking process. Good cook can aways get everything ready quickly and easily. Good teacher do the same thing.</p>

<p>Teachers&#8217; job is adapting the curriculum and materials to local settings and particular learning goals. Effective teachers are aware of what they are currently doing, aways pursueing new effecive ways to teach the same content. It is just like cooks making foods for different customers.  <br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/teacher-transform.png" alt="teacher transfrom" /></p>

<!--more-->


<p>
Teachers&#8217; content knowledge affect their abilities of transfroming the curriculum and materials to students in a special context to acheive a designed learning goal. It is the foundation of science teacher knowledge. If there is no good content knowledge, there is no good content to transform.</p>

<p>It is like the nutrition in the food, if the food contain no nutriton, the best cook can do nothing to help.</p>

<p>It is also like taxi driving. The taxi driver who knows the traffic system well, is possiblely able to figure out the most quick way to go for you at a special time and location. Content knowledge just provide more pathes to consider and follow. Otherwise, it is easy to get lost and embarrassed.
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/traffic-jam.png" alt="traffic jam" /></p>

<h3>Metaphor for education reform:</h3>

<p>Sometimes science teacher educators complain that teachers&#8217; beliefs are stubborn and reluctant to change their practices. Well, It is true.</p>

<p>The teacher is like a swimmer in a river. <br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/teacher-is-swimmer.png" alt="teacher is swimmer" /></p>

<p>The science teacher educator stand on the river bank and tell the swimmer where to go, how to swim, which style is more effective than others. But the most important thing for a person in the river is to keep safty and the most reliable style is the style which he already got. How can we blame them not trying to change, if their safty is not guaranteed and new skills not developed.</p>

<p>As a science teacher educator, you can not always stand by but jump into the water and provide necessary skills and safety.</p>

<p>阅读立法还是阅读项目 - 前些日子阅读立法的事情引起了不少波澜。今天无意注意到UGA道路一角有一排类似垃圾桶的箱子，前面有个学生打开挡板取出一叠报纸边走边看。我也照样子拿了一叠报纸，一开始我还有点犹豫，是不是应该投币什么，但是仔细观察一番原来这是&#8230; http://t.cn/z8lMu7J</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/17/the-ways-that-content-knowledge-matters</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Question:<br/>
What an expert teacher who has deep content knowledge can do?</p>

<p>Notes in class Supervision:<br/>
-give more proper instances, analogys to make student understand clearly<br/>
-relate the knowledge with students lives<br/>
-pick out the important big ideas that organizing the knowledge feild<br/>
-be able to emphasize crosscutting concepts
-be competent in science practices<br/>
-design more logical sequence of the content knowledge<br/>
-be able to understand students&#8217; difficulties and questions and has a clue</p>

<p>Additional ways(after class):<br/>
-ask good questions<br/>
-design sound learning activities and assignments<br/>
-have insights of students question or problems<br/>
-organize facts and concepts in a sense making way or framework<br/>
-have more backup examples,analogys, explainations, questions for use<br/>
-be confident to give students more opotions and more challeging jobs</p>

<p>In a word, content knowledge affect teachers&#8217; abilities of transfroming the curriculum and materials to students in a special context to acheive a designed learning goal. It is the foundation of science teacher knowledge. If there is no good content knowledge, there is no good content to transform.</p>

<p>It is like the nutrition in the food, if the food contain no nutriton, the best cook can do nothing to help.</p>

<p>It is also like taxi driver. The driver who knows the traffic system well, is possiblely able to figure out the most quick way to go for you at a special time and location. Content knowledge just provide more pathes to consider and follow. Otherwise, it is easy to get lost and embarrassed.</p>

    <updated>2013-09-17T11:25:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/17/effective-teaching-notes</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was reading a book <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Clinical_Supervision_and_Teacher_Develop.html?id=O3ycAAAAMAAJ">Clinical Supervision and Teacher Development</a></p>

<p>The following are summary notes of Chapter 3 Using clinical supervision to promote effective teaching.</p>

<p>Characteristics of Good Teaching in Students&#8217; Mind?<br/>
Niss(Nice)<br/>
 *   Nice(respect, patient and easy to get along with)<br/>
 *   Interesting(makes subject interesting and fun with students engaged)<br/>
 *   Sense of humor(tell jokes and smiles a lot)<br/>
 *   Sensitive to students&#8217; need( Listent to students&#8217; question and make changes to help students learn )</p>

<p>Teacher characteristics associated with gain in students&#8217; academic achievement?<br/>
Creati<br/>
 +   Clarity<br/>
 +   Raise Variety(of materials, methods, question types and levels)<br/>
 +   Enthusiasm<br/>
 +   avoid harsh criticism<br/>
 +   Task-oriented<br/>
 +   Indirect teaching style</p>

<p>Substantive interaction that increase students&#8217; at-task time:<br/>
Equal<br/>
  -   Explain(content to students)<br/>
  -   questioning<br/>
  -   using feedback<br/>
  -   assistance<br/>
  -   list the steps or tasks(chunlei added)</p>

<p>Effective Classroom Preconditions:<br/>
Amazing
- Attention and motivation<br/>
- Meaningful(students can find personal meaning in the information being presented)<br/>
- Applications(opportunities to practice using new information)<br/>
- Include both lower-coginitive and higher-cognitive tasks or questions<br/>
- Group work process in the classroom</p>

<p>Notes taken from another book chapter-Glickman -chapter 4.pdf<br/>
Research on effective instruction() indicates that effective instruction is based on adaption of curriculum and materials to local settings and particular learning goals. In other words, effective teachers think about what they are currently doing, assess the results of their practice, explore with each other new possibilities  for teaching students, and are able to consider students&#8217; perspectives.<br/>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/16/i-ignored-number-five-subconsciously</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A strange thing happend when I was reading a book and counting how many columns in a table. To my suprise, the number I counted in English didn&#8217;t equal to the number counted in Chinese. In English the number is nine, but in Chinese it is eight columns. Finallly I found I missed the number five when I was couting in English. What a big discovery!</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why I tend to ignore the number five subconsciously. But there was a real story about the number five. At that time, I was still a college student. Jelle and Ineke, friends of my advisor visited Beijing. It was their first time to be in the city, so I showed them around to visit temples, parks and other spots. We mainly took bus to travel cause it was cheap and we would have chances to experience the Chinese daily lives. One day, we were waiting for No 5 bus. My spoken English was not proficient and often make mistakes expecially in pronunciation. I said to Jelle we were going to take No 5 bus(but I pronunced like &#8220;No file bus&#8221;). But he didn&#8217;t understand. I repeated but still didn&#8217;t make sense. Then after a while, he understood and said No five. He even taught me how to pronunce it correctly. But I was very ashame of that, and still found it difficult for me to pronunce FIVE.</p>

<p>According to Freud&#8217;s Unconscious theory, people tend to ignore or hide the unpleseant experience, this would help to explain my error in English counting.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/reading-program.jpg" alt="Reading Program Box" /></p>

<p>其实发现中国人阅读量不够，心里着急是国人爱国的表现。但是通过行政立法强制阅读其实是行不通的，最简单一条不具有操作性，你怎么检查呢，不读书你还拘留或者罚款吗，另外这样的立法是否有侵犯人权的嫌疑呢。但是如果真的要立法，其实倒是可以给机关、单位、组织立法，强制和支持开展一些阅读项目。比如开放全文数据库，开放大学图书馆，在乡村建设图书信息中心，在地铁提供报刊杂志，当然也需要所有人的配合，比如阅读完的杂志和报刊放回原位，或者在出站前放到指定位置。其实还真是大有可为的，做实事需要从小处着眼往往会更有效。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally find a swimming poor that I can have access in UGA. It is in the Remsey Center just take the next stop of Aderhold by East-West School Bus. I purchased a membership for three months($15 per month). Today I went there to work out and swim. It is really worth every cents.</p>

<p>I took several pictures:<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/work-out.jpg" alt="" /><br/>
I often see people running on the road to do exercise. Sometimes man, sometimes old men stripped to the waist, sometimes women with young boy or girls. In fact, the road in Athens are not flat, so they have to run up and down. They really got the admirable sport spirits.</p>

<p>
The following is a picture of the swimming pool taken from a window.  The water is blue and there many students swimming like fish in the water.<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/swimming-pool.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Today the climbing wall is open for free. It will be one day for free per month. So if you want to try, don&#8217;t miss the boat. <br/>

I am too tired after swimming to try it. May be next time.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/Boy-at-School-Desk.png" alt="Boy at school desk" /><br/>
今天突然注意到一个以前没有思考过的一个学习环境细节，似乎我们使用的课桌和Dr Luft教法课上的并不相同。不同的设计会产生哪些影响呢？</p>

<!--more-->


<p>下面是我们在大学和中学常用的课桌设计。<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/school-desk.png" alt="Two traditional desk" /><br/>
这个是Dr Luft教法课上使用的课桌设计。<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/movable-desk.png" alt="Movable desk" /><br/>
两者的差异就在于，一个容易移动和重新设计座位，一个更适合某种固定的座位排列方式。很显然我们的课桌设计不够灵活，这也为进行小组合作学习设置了潜在的障碍。</p>

<p>根据 Scott, Shaw, and McGuire (2001)提到的Universal Design的9条原则
  1) 均等使用（equitable use）, <br/>
  2) 使用灵活（flexibility in use）, <br/>
  3) 简单易懂（simple and intuitive）, <br/>
  4) 信息可感知（perceptible information）, <br/>
  5) 容忍错误（tolerance for error）, <br/>
  6) 低强度付出（low physical effort）, <br/>
  7) 大小和空间易用（size and space for approach）, <br/>
  8) 面向学习者群体（a community of learners）, <br/>
  9) 教学氛围（instructional climate）。</p>

<p>显然我们的课桌设计不符合第2）和7）条原则。</p>

<p>从课桌的设计可以看出，传统的课桌需求还占据着绝大部分市场分额，那么这又意味着什么？</p>

<p>我们要意识到一点，教学观念会印刻和反映在我们经常熟视无睹的设计当中，新课程改革需要我们重新设计我们的学习环境，同时我们也需要一批优秀的学习环境设计者。</p>

    <link href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/08/31/play-gae-in-ubuntu/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-31T18:07:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/08/31/play-gae-in-ubuntu</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>本来在windows下我是建立了GAE开发环境的，但是python的版本是2.5,GAE的数据库又升级了，但是我又不想再windows下从新布置，觉得很麻烦。所以开始在Ubuntu中布置GAE。事实上在Ubuntu中的布置简单的难以相信。<br/>
首先，下载<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/downloads#Google_App_Engine_SDK_for_Python">Google App Engine SDK for Python</a><br/>
然后解压到你设定的目录（如 /home/）。布置就完成了。</p>

<p>当然有些人喜欢再修改环境变量或者<a href="http://www.php100.com/html/webkaifa/Linux/2010/0807/6386.html">使用In建立字符链接</a>，不过其实不做这些复杂的设置一样很好用。</p>

<p>所以我就什么都没有做。当然前提你已经安装好python2.7了。</p>

<p>下面简单说说，如何发布和测试你的第一个app。过程与windows下差不多，具体可以参考<a href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2010/02/18/knowlege-of-gae/">这里</a>。</p>

<p>首先建立在解压好的google_appengine文件夹中建立一个myapps文件夹用于存放我自己的项目，然后在myapps文件夹下建立一个helloworld文件夹，并在这个文件夹下新建两个文件：helloworld.py以及app.yaml。两个文件的代码可以从<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/gettingstartedpython27/helloworld">这里</a>拷贝。<br/>
测试你的项目，在google_appengine文件下打开终端，使用如下命令：</p>

<pre><code>
$ python dev_appserver.py myapps/helloworld
</code></pre>


<p>打开<a href="http://localhost:8080/">http://localhost:8080/</a>查看效果。</p>

<p>ctrl+C 终止测试。</p>

<p>使用如下命令上传项目（前提是你已经申请并在GAE上建立好了hellowrld应用）：</p>

<pre><code>
$ python appcfg.py update myapps/helloworld
</code></pre>


<p>这样你的app就上传好了，打开地址欣赏一下吧。</p>
