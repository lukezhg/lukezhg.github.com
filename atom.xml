    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>花了整整一天的时间才把信息技术和专业英语的作业、论文以及学习总结看完。我觉得挺享受这个过程的，每一个英语小论文都是一个故事，一个实实在在奋斗和挣扎在一线岗位青年教师的故事，真心希望大家也能相互彼此阅读，看看其他同学经历的，收获的，付出的，还有抉择。另外大家的学习总结也让我对课程进行了重新的审视和反思，同学们提了很好的意见，有鼓励，也有批评，这些都是我做未来课程计划的重要依据，这点我很看重。我也会加倍努力！</p>

<p>有的时候只有从一个环境中走出来，才能更好的审视自己，不知道你们是否有同感。教师这一行要求我们必须保持开放的心态，接受你的学生，接纳新的技术，新的思想，新的策略。如果一下接受不了那么多，那么可以从一点点做起。上课的时候我们同学使用了prezi,现在我也开始使用prezi来，而且越用越好用了，这就是开放的心态，尝试的心态，遇到新东西，不是说no，而应该向老外学习说why not。我觉得作为教师，没有哪一点比这更重要了。走出来，不仅仅空间，更是思考方式和观念。愿我们都能永远具有敞开来、走出去的勇气和信念。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I went to the Main library of UGA. I had a task to search a journal from 1980 to 1990. It was my first time to be there. To my suprise, nobody stopped me to check my UGA card. So I just went around and check out the journels. It means everybody can come in and take a seat to read. It is great! The frist floor is very big and open. The book and magzines are located in the center, surrounded by many groups of tables, seats and computers. Although many students studying there, it was very quiet. I ask a library staff how to find the journal, he helped me to check it out in his computer and told me it is located at the second floor and it is also available online. So I just came out. It was at the noon, I took a picture of the main library, it is beautiful. <br/>

<p>
I also found some interesting things at Aderhold where College of Education located. The first thing was the emergency chair at the corner of stairwell. You can break the window and use the chair to take somebody hurt going downstairs. What a considerate safety concern! You can find an emergency shower at every classroom, which hardly seen in Chinese classroom.<br/>

<p>When I entered the building in the morning, I found there were lots of names on the bricks. I guess there are the names of professors who had worked there. <br/>

<p>When I kept looking, I saw a brick which said: &#8220;stop read the bricks, go to study&#8221;. I smiled and entered the building.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes it is hard to let students collect data to test their ideas about nature. For example to make observations how stars move for a long time, or do experiment about why plant grow to the sunlight. In this case, when oboservation and experiment difficult to carry out in classroom, computer software or interactive simulations can help a lot. There are two examples.</p>

<p>In a middle school biology class, students can play with the following flash game to figure out why plant grow to the sun.</p>

In a elementary school science class, student can stuy how much water does a crow drink every day. They can also study their own diet using the same method.</p>

<p>Interactive simulations can help:<br/>
-   enage students, just give a cool show and some questions, then let them play with it.
-   stimulate students to ask questions
-   make observations and collect data or evidences<br/>
-   test their ideas</p>

<p>If teachers can guide and organize them to make explainations or argue with each other based on evidence, and make predictions and test them, at last provide opportunities for self-evaluation and community evaluations, then this approach would be more effective for learning science in classroom.</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/08/19/modeling-activities-and-reflection</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I attended Dr Luft&#8217;s class Methods of Science Teaching. I am becoming more and more interested in Modeling activities and I want to make a collection of these activities.</p>

<p>This is the list:<br/>
-   Candle in the water tube make it go out(Dr Luft&#8217;s class)<br/>
-   Black box(<a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11102">How students learn: science in classroom</a> see Chp 12)<br/>
-   Timms video <a href="http://timssvideo.com/72">JP5 AIR COMPRESSION AND EXPANSION</a><br/>
-   Secret Tube (Dr C&#8217;s class)<br/>
-   Next Generation Science Standards <a href="http://concord.org/ngss/">simulation activities in Concord</a><br/>
If you have more good modeling activities, welcome recommandations.</p>

<p>These activities provide lots of practice options for science teachers. We usually only provide standards of what students should master but little practice activites for teachers. Well, the <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards">Next Generation Standard</a> is going to change this.</p>

<p>Reflections on Modeling in science teaching<br/>
The charm of modeling:<br/>
-   Naturally need students to make careful observation,recording data,drawing conclusions<br/>
-   Naturally engage students&#8217; prior ideas for explaination or application<br/>
-   Naturally put students into the test, debate and revisement of their models or prior ideas<br/>
-   Naturally let students experience the full process of science inquiry and nature of science</p>

<p>What to focus in the modeling activites as a science teacher?</p>

<p>How to keep the balance between knowledge-centered and student-centered? Individual and Community? Cognition and metacognition?</p>

<p>Welcome to join the discussion of these open questions!</p>

    <updated>2013-08-19T22:19:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/08/19/metaphors-of-good-teacher-and-education-reform</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A good teacher just like a good cook. Of course, you can tell a good cook by the taste of his dishes. So students&#8217; perfect performance is a good predictor of competent teacher. But it takes a lot effort to make the dishes OR evaluate the students. In fact, we can also tell a good cook by his preparation and operation of his cooking.  Good cook can aways make many dishes in a limited time. Because he don&#8217;t stop, when heating the water, he is washing the vegatables or cutting the meat. When the water is ready he is also ready to fry them together. The teacher do the same thing in class expecially in a short class. I found this metaphor visiting Dr C&#8217;s class, she give instructions as well as preparing the tools for modeling, at the same time she was also doing demonstration of what the secret tube behaviors.</p>

<p>Sometimes science teacher educators complain that teachers&#8217; beliefs are stubborn and reluctant to change their practices. Well, It is true.</p>

<p>The science teacher is like a swimming player in a swimming poor. The science teacher educator stand beside and tell the player how to swim, which style is good which is bad. But the most important thing for a person in the swimming poor is to keep safty and the most reliable style is his primary style. How can we blame them not trying to change, if their safty is not guaranteed and skills not developed.</p>

<p>As a science teacher educator, you can not stand by but jump into the swimming poor and provide necessary skills and safety.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is my first time to view a science classroom teaching in Japan. In fact, it supprise me a little. I know the science education in Japan is of high quality. They get much better score than the other counties and teacher are respectable profession. But I never thought the classroom are so interactive and effective. You can click <a href="http://timssvideo.com/72">here</a> to view the video.</p>

<blockquote><p>This eighth-grade science lesson is about the formation of clouds. It is the third lesson in a sequence of 19 lessons on weather. The lesson is 53 minutes in duration. There are 25 students in the class.<br/>
<video width='720' height='480' preload='none' controls poster=' https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/timssvideo.png'><source src='http://timssvid1.s3.amazonaws.com/JP5%20Air%20compression%20and%20expansion.mp4' type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'/></video></p></blockquote>

<p>Here is my record of the time usage of the class:</p>

<blockquote><p>00-03 review what learnt<br/>
03-07 demistration<br/>
07-17 demistration of key skills for today&#8217;s experiment<br/>
18-36 Student activites(4 experiments and group take turn)<br/>
36-50 sumary of experiment result and draw conclusion<br/>
50-52 self-evalation</p></blockquote>

<p>I watched the video twice, first I just got a glance of it very quickly. The second time, I watch it very carefully and make notes of what teacher and students were doing.</p>

<p>First, I found a very interesting thing that the Japenese teacher used about 17 minutes to engage students and make demonstration at the begining. He also used about 17 minutes to sumary the results and conclusions at the end of the class. Acording to psychology studies, people are most likely to remember what happened at begining and at the end. People usually can only concentrate for 15 minutes. So most TED videos will not last more than 17 minutes. I don&#8217;t know if the teacher did it popurely. But he did it really well.</p>

<p>Second, the class is very interesting and vigorous. Students really had fun with the activities and record and try to explain.</p>

<p>Third, it keep a good balance of knowledge-centered and student-centered. The most important ideas and inquiry skills were embodied in student activities.</p>

<p>At last, I want to say although the teacher said nothing about modeling. But he raised a question for students to study.  Students want to explain but had little idea and experieces. So they did the activities that teacher prepared for them. Before experiments, they make their explannation and predictions, they recorded the result on the handouts, they have to revise their explanation and building a more powerful causal model to explain all the phenomenons. So we do can found the shape of modeling in this class.</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/08/16/design-for-convinence-for-people</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most deep impressions I got of US is the pursuing of simple and comfortable life.</p>

<p>First is the bus design.<br/>
There is a button out side of the bus that customers can push to kneel the bus. Another design is that there is a string along the windows. You can pull the string to let bus stop. You don&#8217;t even need to stand up.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing I discovered the yellow alert along the road. First I though it is to let people wark accross the street. But when I look into it carefully, It said &#8220;State law: stop when human on the line&#8221;, it is for the car. No wonder evertime when I was on the line, the drive will stop let me pass first. What a nice law!  <br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/statelaw.jpg" alt="Statelaw" /><br/>
One day, when I was on my way home from supermarket, I found there is an American Bank ATM special for car drivers near the shops. I have never saw such ATM before in China. You don&#8217;t have to get out of your car when you using the ATM In China, when you go to banks, usually you have wait for half an hour to get your turns in Shanghai. Why it is so different! This is a really good question to think about.</p>

<p>The last discovery is kitchen. They have kitchen not only in the apartment where I live but also in the office. There is a special kitchen room for professors and students to heat their lunch or make coffee. So nice!<br/>
Oh, I nearly forget. The water ﻿purifier﻿. It is so cool and useful, I love it too much.<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/water.jpg" alt="water purifier" /></p>

<p>It is evident that the goal of American people is to pursue a simple and comfortable life. Maybe not very luxurious but comfortable.</p>

<p>How did they achieve that, market and competition may be the driving power. What it doesn&#8217;t happen in China? Big question!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you want to run away confronting a challenge. Usually, you have your own reasons. It is too hard. It is too boring. I am not good at this. It is so painful. You want to advoid to meet it although it is important and urgent. We all know it but feel so hard to control yourself.</p>

<p>So what to do?</p>

<p>YOU have an imaginary enemy to fight. Game start! Sometimes your enemy is strong and sometimes he is endurable. Mostly, you have exaggerated your enemy and belittled yourself. Imagine you are fighting against an enemy who also have his own weakness. The wise move would be found his weakness and take all the advantage you have to beat him. If you don&#8217;t fight, you are doomed to failure. If you fight, there still a hope to win.</p>

<p>In fact, you have no opotions but to fight. Your imaginary enemy would alert you and help you to beat the fearness and win the game!</p>

    <updated>2013-08-02T06:08:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/08/02/observation-of-daily-life-of-americans</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These days while I live in my apartment, I pay close attention to the daily life of people here. I have drawed a conclusion: Americans are lazy.</p>

<p>In fact, Lazy here is not used in a derogatory sense. You know, only the lazy people can invent and design a comfortable life. Americans are such kind of designers who are persueing simple but comfortable life. Let me give you some examples.</p>

<p>I live in a house department. In China, the parking area is often underground or a little far from the appartment. But in USA, the parking lot is jut in front of the hourse near the door. You can imagine when you get back from work, get out of your car, and then enter your door, it is so convinent.</p>

<p>After you get in, you can find a kitchen, a sitting room, a laundry room and a bath room. If you take a look at the kitchen, you will find a dish washer there and microwave oven. In China, most people just wash by hands, you can hardly found a dish washer, expecially in a student&#8217;s department.</p>

<p>As to food, most food can be cooked just by heatting, like milk and bread. If sauces are needed, they are already mixed up and ready for use. You can find all this kind of mixed up sauces or semi-manufactured food everywhere in a food supermaket. Cooking become easy here, athough the taste may becoming a little dull. Most Chinese will not buy the mixed sauces, they may want to make their own although they will spent a lot of time on cooking.</p>

<p>One day, a ceaseless noise of machinery wake me up. I look out through the window, I found a man is using a grass cutter in front of the door. In China, people also use this kind of grass cutter, which is belted to the waist. But lawn mower like a car is hardly found in China. I often saw an american sitting on it and drive it on the lawn, it is fun. I also found people here clean the street in a differnt way, they use a air blower to blow the leaves away and make the road clean. If you walk on street in the early morning in Beijing, you will see a cleaner clean street with broom. You will never found a man with a blowing machine walk here and there.</p>

<p>And almost everyone have a car here. Once I ask a black man for directions, after telling my the way, he said don&#8217;t you have a car, I sait not yet. He then added while it will be 20 to 30 minutes&#8217; walk. I follow his directions, after 10 minutes I got there. It is not that far, I said in my mind. May be they drive too much, and then have no idea how long it will take by walking.</p>

<p>So there are so many differences between the two countries. It also stand for different culture. The Americans are taking every advantage of modern science and technology to make their lives simple and comfortable. Labor is much more expensive in USA than in China. The Chinese culture advocate deligent, hard-working and Obedience.  The American culture advocate Science &amp; Technolgy, comfortable life and freedom. You can not say which one is better, but they can learn from each other.  Athough the American life is easy and comfortable, but it exhausted much more energy. Athough, Chinese food is delicious, but it is time cousuming, I think Chinese really should spend more time on inovation in S&amp;T and social system.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a dream today. I took a flight back to home just in order to make sure everthing at home is Ok. I don&#8217;t konw why. There is an old saying what you dream at night is what you think at day. Maybe I am a little homesick now. When I am awake, I am laying on a big white bed still in USA. I thought I will not easily be homesick, but I am wrong. Well my advisor is right, I will confront some hard time and even shed tears. If it was the Cost, what I can do is only maximize the benifit.</p>

<p>I have learnt how to cook rice in microwave oven. I also learn how to cook dishes in a pan which the bottom is flat.  I have been accustomed to the food here, milk and egg for breakfast, noodles or rice for lunch and supper. I improve my spoken and writing English through participting some online courses. It does work.</p>

<p>I will also record what I have done, observed and thought by bloging. It will cover all the stories that I experienced during my study in USA.</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>dir(list)
显示关键字相关的函数</p>

<p>help(list.reverse)
查询某个函数的功能</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>set 让一个list变成无重复元素的set
例如：</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>shapes = [&#8216;circle&#8217;,&#8217;square&#8217;,&#8217;triangle&#8217;,&#8217;circle&#8217;]

setOfShapes &amp; setOfFavoriteShapes
setOfShapes | setOfFavoriteShapes</p></blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>

<p>map和lambda</p>

<blockquote><blockquote><blockquote><p>map(lambda x: x * x, [1,2,3])
[1, 4, 9]
filter(lambda x: x > 3, [1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1])

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/07/30/fighting-with-display-problem-with-my-computer</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These days I am fighting with the Display Card Problem of my computer. Befor coming to Georgia, My coumputer can not start normaly, the screen is black, athough you can hear the sound of login. I try to ingnore this problem by using another OS Ubuntu in my comuputer.  BUT, unfortianaly, I can&#8217;t use the PAWS wireless network of UGA in Ubuntu. So I have to solve the Display problem in WIN7 or the wireless connection problem in Ubuntu. Guess what, neither of the problem is easy to trackle.</p>

<p>Finally, I solved the Display Problem using following steps:<br/>
+   setup the two display driver software in my drivers folder in C disk.<br/>
+   setup the downloaded display controler, uncheck the quick stream function<br/>
+   everything comes to normal although I still can&#8217;t use swticheable display mode in BIOS</p>

<p>What I learn from this:<br/>
+   never buy a computer with two display card fire together<br/>
+   if you have important thing just leave these problems there, important thing come frist<br/>
+   reflect and record your problem solving process</p>

    <updated>2013-07-29T00:32:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/07/29/how-to-write-your-lesson-plan</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>经常有学生或教师问我该如何说课或者写教案。我听到后，第一反应是“查”。为什么不自己主动查一查，如何说课这个问题呢。肯定有很多资源的。在我看来，说合写都是表达教学设计的方式而已，关键还是教学设计。说其实是口头表达，其实如果你能写好教案，设计好教学，那么我相信你也能表达好。所以最关键的是理清自己的教学思路。自己都不清晰，怎么能指望别人听懂呢，更别指望受到赞赏和认可了。</p>

<p>我觉得说课要做到以下几点：<br/>
一、说课的内容一定要包括：教学目标、前段分析、教学思路-问题线索-学习活动、最后是学习检测。第一部分相当你是你要告诉别人，你要去哪，第二部分是“路况”如何，第三部分是你要如何走，第四部分是你如何知道你离目的地还有多远。<br/>
二、说课形式可以是多样的，可以借助ppt，也可以借助概念图，我推荐使用概念图，因为它能让你兼顾部分和整体、学习目标与学习活动之间的联系以及学习活动的过度和衔接等。这些都是新手教师容易忽略的。</p>

<p>三、说课的境界<br/>
-   最基本的是让人听懂，知道你要如何上这门课，这是第一个层次，也是最基本的层次。<br/>
-   第二层是让人不仅知道你怎么上，还知道你为什么这么上，教学是教师有意识的行动。<br/>
-   第三个层次，是让人觉得你是在创造性的解决实际问题，并且认同你的做法的合理性和可行性，教学是基于研究和经验摸索的创新尝试。</p>

<p>四、说课好坏的评判标准，
-   第一是教学目标设计和表述是否合理。<br/>
-   第二前段分析是否扎实、全面，是否包括学情分析、教材内容分析以及学习需要分析，是否能依据分析确定合理的教学目标。<br/>
-   第三教学思路是否清晰，问题线索是否自然，学习活动是否能帮助学生达成教学目标。<br/>
-   第四是否设计了新问题情境检测学生的学习成果和教学目标达成情况。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>我将在佐治亚访学一年，这一年的时间里我想用日志记录。记录我的所看、所感。</p>

<p>7月25号上午9点从上海飞往东京，转机飞亚特兰大。在东京停留了2个小时左右，我趁机买了一些日本的特产，包括绿茶和点心，这些小礼物是给接我的博士生R买的。一路上都很顺利，去亚特兰大的飞机上，坐在我左边的是一个中国人，右边的似乎是一个墨西哥人，很胖很壮，不过也很友善。我填写的海关表时，还向他借了笔，此外也问了他一些关于I94 departure record的问题，他回答的很耐心。</p>

<p>一路上我要莫看录像，要莫睡觉，为倒时差做准备。当然聊的比较多的还是与左边的中国留学生，他在英国留学，这次去美国看妈妈，我问他Groome shutle怎么坐，他说他也要做shutle，后来我给他看手机上的信息，结果其实他也是要做这个shutle的但是不是同一个线路而已。 于是我们商量好一起走。</p>

<p>从飞机下来要走很远，才能到海关检查的地点。然后排队等候，一个旅客无意识掏出了手机，结果给工作人员看见了，要求他拿着手机给检查官看，检查官是个黑人，盘问的半天检查了手机才让他继续排队。原因是这个地方是禁止拍照的。</p>

<p>盘查我的也是那个黑人警官，他问了2个问题，你来美国看什么，你研究什么，还让我出示了邀请信，之后才改了章放我过去。过了海关就去认领行李，一开始我以为应该有工作人员扫描条形码然后给我们行李，结果到了哪啥都没有，就是一个电子牌指示哪个航班的行李在哪个转盘上，我们等了半天，最后我的行李先出来了，由于我的班车是5点多的，我看了时间只有20分钟左右，我就自己先走了。 机场的地图虽然下载过，但是没什么用，有用的还是问路，问了一个警官，他告诉我做3路机场公车就可以，我赶紧去坐车，还好顺利赶到了。</p>

<p>我赶到的时候，只有2位乘客没有上车了，司机是个白人，长头发，很帅气，我告诉他我定了位置，他帮我放好行李，然后查看了记录手册，并让我付钱，结果我拿出一百美元，他说没有零钱。我问是否可以用信用卡，他说可以打电话，于是他帮我打通了电话，我说明了情况，报告了信用卡信息，结果就成功支付了。下车的时候，我看到有乘客给小费，但是很不巧我只有一百美元的，所以我说了谢谢，并解释了一下，他说没关系的。下车有机会再给吧。</p>

<p>我下了shutle，但是发现根本没有人等我，不过刚刚过了3分钟R先生就开车到了。我请他吃了快餐，本来还要买sim卡的，但是兜了很久也没找到，于是他送我去HSC入住。在工作人员的提示下，我填写了几张表格，就拿到了钥匙入住了。悬着的心终于放下来了，美国我来了。</p>
