    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>不必提世界排名，也不必提诺贝尔奖。单看看其大学的设计和其理念，就知道中国的大学和人家不在一个重量级上。</p>

<p>之所以得出这个结论，主要基于以下事实：<br/>
1  美国的大学是没有围墙的，大学与周边的社区相互融合，任何人都可以随随便便进入大学。一句话大学是开放的，向所有人开放。</p>

<p>2  美国的大学图书馆没有门禁，任何人都可以进去看书。这点很让我意外，第一次进入图书馆的时候，我还在想是否要刷校园卡，结果一路畅通，一直走到了书架下面拿起一本书，也没有任何人询问或者阻拦。这意味着任何人都可以使用大学图书馆的图书资源，大学的图书馆是真正的公共资源，向所有人开放。</p>

<p>前些日子，国内就是否要读书立法争吵不休，参见<a href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/14/reading-legislation-or-reading-program/">阅读立法还是阅读立项</a>。与其冠冕堂皇的立法，还不如开放中国大学的图书馆来的实际。</p>

<p>3  美国的大学设置了学习中心，为学生搭建理想的学习环境。学生可以免费使用电脑完成功课，或者预约房间进行写作，再或者约几个朋友聚在一起完成某个合作项目。学习中心和图书馆都设有专门的桌椅和白板等供团队学习使用。</p>

<p>美国的大学随处都有wifi，有电源插口，甚至在过道里，很多学生坐在走廊的地毯上用电脑学习或者等候。我记得我曾经到国内某个职业学校的图书馆，好不容易找到了桌椅，却就是找不到电源，可下找到了电源却是大型机器使用的电源，笔记本用不了。他们是故意这样设计的，真是“聪明”得不行。于是没办法，我只好问管理员我是否可以进入电脑浏览室使用一下他们的电源，管理员回答的很干脆：“不可以”。他们的逻辑很简单，你用我们的电脑才会交钱，不能让你白用电。估计即使是他们学校的学生也不行，因为他根本没问我是不是本校的师生。</p>

<p>4  美国的大学是教授治校。王笛曾经在南方周末的一篇文章中这样描述教授治校：教授们各司其职，无行政掣肘。系里除教授以外的所有人员，都是为教授服务的。<a href="#1">[1]</a> 这个说法与我所见是吻合的，没有臃肿的管理机构，不需要特别面见领导，也没有复杂的手续和开不完的会议，一切从简。</p>

<p>我有些奇怪，为什么中国大学要养那么多的行政机关和不担负任何教学科研任务的人员，为什么总是有开不完的会和办不完的手续，为什么办什么事总要领导批示或者看领导脸色。这样环境会有怎样的教授人格？这样的教授人格又会熏陶出怎样的学生？难怪很多大学社团也官位十足，潜规则四处可见。<a href="#2">[2]</a></p>

<p>相比之下，中国大学就像一个封闭、自利的“公司衙门”，不仅唯利是图而且严重官僚化，失去了大学应有的独立精神和社会责任感。</p>

<p>中国大学啊！你当如何存在？</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/11/27/lifespan-of-chinese</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>一个人的寿命是有限的。在这有限的时间里，你都在干些什么，也就决定了一个人生命的意义。有些人喜欢勾心斗角，有些人喜欢探究自然和内心，有些人喜欢攀比炫耀，有些人喜欢释然自知，于是有了形形色色的人物，演绎人间百态。</p>

<p>无论你是谁，都会平等的面对一件事，那就是死亡。但是不同人群面对它的时间确可以不同，这就是该人群的平均寿命期望。</p>

<p>根据官方人口普查的结果，中国人整体的平均寿命一直在增长，2010年已经达到74.8岁。<a href="#1">[1]</a> 这与医疗卫生条件的改善息息相关，虽然不见得延长一个人高品质生活的时段，但确实能续命和降低某些疾病的风险。</p>

<p>不同人群的寿命有很大的不同，这与很多因素有关，比如性别、居住地、甚至职业。根据普查结果，男性平均寿命72.4岁，女性77.4岁，女性比男性平均高5岁。它也可能与居住地有关。一项由美国、中国和以色列学者共同完成的研究显示，中国北方数十年来烧煤引起的严重空气污染导致人均寿命减少至少5年。<a href="#2">[2]</a> 不同省市地区的平均人口寿命也有很大差异，北京、上海、天津都达到80岁以上，但是很多经济相对落后的地区平均寿命则低于国家整体水平。<a href="#3">[3]</a> 有报道称中国大城市人均寿命比农村高12年。<a href="#4">[4]</a> 这其实与城乡医疗卫生差距难脱关系。此外，它可能与行业有关。国家体改委2009年的调查结果显示，近5年内，共有135人中国科学院和北京大学的教授、专家逝世，平均年龄仅有53.3岁。我国肩负重任的知识分子平均寿命仅为58岁，比全国人均寿命低10岁左右。<a href="#5">[5]</a></p>

<p>知道这些数据可以帮助我们做出一些个人决策，比如估算自己的寿命期望，并恰当的使用自己的时间，养成良好的生活方式。此外也可以帮助我们做出一些宏观的政策或者暴漏一些亟待解决的社会问题。比如农村的医疗和养老问题。<br/>
前段时间参加了一门网络课程，我曾经为自己做了一张图，让自己对生活进行重新的审视。<br/>

<p>今天看到了搜狐上的一篇<a href="http://cul.sohu.com/s2011/xiongpeiyun/">采访稿</a>，采访的是《一个村庄里的中国》作者熊培云。有一段话，我特别喜欢，摘录如下：</p>

<blockquote><p>熊培云：我第一个心愿，是把我的家庭从农村里拯救出来。我书里写了一件事情：我祖母生病，在短短几个小时内突然过世了——我的父亲和我的姑姑当时用板车推着他，半路就过世了。这么多年我一直强调“自救”，如果自己家里都管不好，担不起这个责任，说为天下做事那很矫情。我改了一个词儿：“以天下为己任”，最先做的“以己任为天下”。<a href="http://cul.sohu.com/s2011/xiongpeiyun/">[来源：搜狐读书会&#8211;熊培云]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>特别是这句“以己任为天下”，它说的不是自私自利，而是达己达人。</p>

<p>佐治亚开学见面会上，系主席说过一句话，“不要关注别人是否来上班”，因为有的时候别人的工作是你看不到的，你只看到他好几天没有来办公室，殊不知他正在四处奔波收集数据。这种关注不仅无助于他人，而且会妨碍自己。我在想，为什么不把宝贵的时间和精力留给自己呢，也许你会说“我上班，他不上班”这不公平。但是，人人都应该为他自己上班不是吗？如果上班是自己的事，那么为什么不管好自己的事呢？如果上班是别人的事，那么你又为什么要管别人的事呢？所以我个人觉得坐班制对于教师来说，简直无聊之极。</p>

<p>一个学院是如此，一个家庭也是如此。不要担心家庭的其他成员不履行责任，只要做好你自己。每个人都应该以给其他家庭成员创造福利为荣，若总是担心吃亏，那还算是哪门子家庭。</p>

<p>There are many amazing things that robot can do. They become more clever and skilled in lots of feild: Some robots talk; Some walk; Some can carry; Some fly; Some can drive; Some teach; Some have expressions; Some have skins.</p>

<p>Today I watched a TED video in which robots help Henry &#8211; a stroke patient &#8211; regain his life.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In agriculture age,people don&#8217;t have to worry about pollution. Because all the products are degradable. Nature itself is a great designer, everything can be reused and recycled. But as human entered the age of industry, the situation changed. Human want to create new stuff that never existed in natural world. Yes they made it but they are not born good designers; Many waste are produced but can not be recycled.</p>

<p>There is a simple logic. If human want live in earth forever, then everything should be recycled, otherwise there will be not enough resources or room for human beings.</p>

<p>China have made a miracle of economic growth, but the growth cost dear &#8211; air and water pollution, increasing gap between rich and poor, village and city, east and west. This growth also can not be sustainable because the environment is getting worse and worse and the resources is getting fewer and fewer. In order to live a healthy life, China must reconsider its style of economic growth and design more environmentally friendly industry,agriculture and living system. But do China have enough designers to design the eco-life system? It is questionalble. STEM education may play a crucial role in preparing these future designers in China.</p>

<p>If you look into Chinese secondary and primary curriculum, you will find there is little content of enginering or designing in their class learning activities. How to assess the curriculum content to tell if it is updated and suitable for preparing future citizens? How teachers address this problem in their classroom teaching? Is there a lack of designing education in our curriculum system? If not, is the content and education good enough for preparing our future designers? These questions matters for the future development of China.</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/11/25/risk-management</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have never learn to how control risk in my education. Recently, several things I experienced force me to pay more attention to this issue.</p>

<p>After watched a film &#8220;Mongol&#8221;, I want to use my iphone to contact my family. But I can&#8217;t find it. I used to put it on my desk or pocket, but it is not there. I checked a lot of other places, the bed, drawers, kichens, even closet and clothes. It still didn&#8217;t show up. I began to worry about it, I felt my heart beating quickly, I wondered if I lost it in my road back from food store. It would be a disaster if I really lost it, because many personal information was in it.</p>

<p>I sit down infront of the desk and tried to calm down. I still could not figure out where it can be left. Suddenly an idea come to my mind, how can i check out if the phone was in my hourse using wifi. Could I try to contack the person who found it? So I trun on my computer and use QQ(a kind of software like skype) to send a message to my iphone. The messeage said &#8220;Could you return my iphone?&#8221;, then I clicked sent button and heared a sound in the room. It was from my phone. I tried to send again and listen where the sound come from. Finally I found my phone lay on the carpet under my bed. It must slip onto the carpet from my bed.</p>

<p>I had a great relief. Then I began to think what to do to reduce the risk of losing my iphone. How to keep my personal informaton safer. I read serveral posts on tips to keep your iphone safe. They suggested first you should set a password for unlocking. Then you can also install an app called &#8220;find my iphone&#8221; to locate your phone in case you lost it. The last suggestion is do not keep important personal information in your phone.</p>

<p>In fact, all these tips are trying to control the risk or reduce the risk. In dealiing with risk, we have serveral options, sometimes we have to accept it, there are always a risk that you can do nothing to control, e.g. traffic accident. In this case, people usually buy insurance to transfer the risk to insurer. We can also take some measures to ruduce the risk, such as put a piece of paper with your email or address at the back of your phone. If somebody find your phone, he or she may return it to you according to the information you provided. I found I need to learn more about risk management and get prepared for any risk in the future.</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/11/25/emotion-control</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes people lost control of their emotion, which usually do harm to themselves and others. It is an very important thing to learn to control and even make use of one&#8217;s emotion.</p>

<p>Emotion takes long time to form and change. It is like the parameters in hidden layer of NN, taking more instances to evolve and even more instances to adapt themselves to new changes. Emotion can help people to judge people and things(e.g.. good or bad, friends or enemy) and decide what to do(e.g.. quit or persist). It can also work as the energy source of people. People are most easily motivated by emotion than reason. Students tend to remember something deeply with a special emotion aroused. You would also feel very strange if you are talking with some people emotionless and feel hard to build trust on his.</p>

<p>Although, emotion play a very important role in our life, but we usually ignore emotion education in our formal or informal education. We should provide opportunity for people to know how emotion affect our cognition and social interactions. How to cope with ones&#8217; emotion and keep emotional health.</p>

    <link href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/11/23/patent-a-special-knowledge-as-private-property/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-23T12:04:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/11/23/patent-a-special-knowledge-as-private-property</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Why we introduces the idea of patent?<br/>
Patent is a commercial idea based on market. A patent is a limited property right the government gives inventors in exchange for their agreement to share details of their inventions with the public. Like any other property right, it may be sold, licensed, mortgaged, assigned or transferred, given away, or simply abandoned.[<a href="#1">1</a>] We can see the rationale of patent is to disclose the innovations to public domains for common good. What to do if patents are going to violate this original rationale? Should we still protect patents or abandon it?</p>

<p>What can be patented? What can&#8217;t or shouldn&#8217;t?<br/>
In order to apply for a patent the inventor should provide information about how to made and use this invention. Basically, this is a kind of knowledge about &#8220;how&#8221;. So patent is both a special knowledge and a private property(intellectual property). Usually, a private property such as a chair is unique in the world and can not be given to others without losing it. But knowledge and information are different. We can transmit them without losing them. This is how education and media works. Patent means you can know it but you can&#8217;t use it without license or permission. But people naturally can make use of their knowledge. It should be legal for people to make use of their knowledge to know and help themselves. So there is a question, should a special knowledge be patentable? <br/>
Case 1:<br/>
There is an interesting case about patent. Mr. Bowman bought gene-modified seed from Monsanto company to plant in his form. For that second crop, he bought seeds from a grain elevator filled with a mix of seeds in the reasonable hope that many of them contained Monsanto’s patented Roundup Ready gene.[<a href="#2">2</a>] Monsanto brought Mr. Bowman to the court for abuse of seeds with their patented Roundup Ready gene. Mr. Bowman argued that it is the natural right to make any use of the seeds that you bought. The patent should be in exhaustion when I bought the seeds from grain elevator.</p>

<p>But Mr. Bowman still lost the case. This is what Justice Kagan said:
“Under the patent exhaustion doctrine, Bowman could resell the patented soybeans he purchased from the grain elevator; so too he could consume the beans himself or feed them to his animals. But the exhaustion doctrine does not enable Bowman to make additional patented soybeans without Monsanto’s permission, that is precisely what Bowman did.” [<a href="#3">3</a>]</p>

<p>Case 2<br/>
There is another case, a farmer grow his corn in his form. But his neighborhood grew gene-modified corn, by accident the wind blow the pollen with modified gene to his farm. So his corn also had the modified gene. But the farmer planted corn for a Japan company that only want corn without modified gene. So he can couldn&#8217;t sell his corn to the company and lost lot of money. Who should pay for his lost?</p>

<p>Case 3<br/>
A family invented a new kind of food(toy for cat). They keep the making process secret. But later it has been stolen and patented. Although they have made this new food for many years, now it become illegal to keep their business without paying for the patent. Is it fair? How about second time independent invention?</p>

<p>Although, in the first case, Mr. Bowman was intently to make use of the loophole of second buying. But it still annoy my nerves when thinking of gene-modified plant take the place of the other plants that farmers can grow and plant without any limitation, gene-modified food went into market without label, modified gene go to other plan species without control. A question emerged from this case is that Should gene be patentable?</p>

<p>How about human gene? Here is an interesting video &#8220;Who Owns You? 20% of the Genes in Your Body are Patented&#8221;.[<a href="#4">4</a>]</p>

<iframe src="http://zhangchunlei.com//player.vimeo.com/video/11755917" width="500" height="281" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>This let me reflect the following questions: Should human gene be patentable? Will these patents prohibit us to know more about ourselves and make use our knowledge to benefit ourselves? Will this go against individual human rights? Is patent, or commercialization a good idea in education and human society in future?</p>

    <link href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/11/22/suppose-you-are-the-premier/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-22T19:05:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/11/22/suppose-you-are-the-premier</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>小学的时候曾经写过题为“假如我是校长”的作文。今天我们换一个题目：“假如我是总理”。题目有点大，也许是异想天开，不过多些这样的异想似乎并无坏处。</p>

<p>我本是个农村人，假如我是总理，我会这样建设新农村。</p>

<p>第一件要做的事就是把互联网以尽可能低的价格（甚至免费）通到农村，让农民能够上网了解这个飞速发展的世界，同时也能有更多的机会学习。</p>

<p>第二件事是发展基于农村的农民教育，建立农民学校，招志愿者讲课和经营管理学校，也可以借助民间力量。此外还要鼓励高校推出适合农村的职业课程。科技是第一生产力，学习是科技原动力。</p>

<p>第三件迫在眉睫的事情是环境保护问题。北京和上海的空气污染严重，很多省市地区的水污染也十分严重。污染容易，治理污染则需要几代人的努力。所以环境保护应该放在经济增长之前，环境治理和保护就是第一政绩。我们可以不富有，但是我们一定要确保健康。对于环境问题，要建立妥善的监督机制，甚至可以启用全民监管。对于污染严重的企业必须停产转型。</p>

<p>第四件事就是建立农村医院，解决农村看病难的问题。所有农村医生都需要经过正规认证，向当地人开设医学课程，提供学徒制，建立重点医院与农村医院信息通道，利用信息技术提供远程诊治服务和技术支持。此外还要普及生活保健常识。很多的疾病都与不健康的生活饮食方式有关，开设课程的成本远比医疗成本低的多。</p>

<p>第五件事是辅助农业和农民转型。将来农业机械化后，可定不需要现在这么多的劳动力，那么很大一部分农民肯定要转变成其他行业从事着，比如制造业或者服务业。畅通农村的物流网络，降低物流成本，让村里的产品能够运出去，让外面的商品能购进来，无疑会有助于农村制造业的发展。对农村制造业的扶植和对农民的培训则有助于农民身份的转型。从而避免失业等社会不良问题的发生。</p>

<p>农民之所以涌向城市，无非是因为城市打工收入会更高，医疗、卫生、教育条件更好。反过来想一想，也是因为我们的优质资源过于集中地缘故。于是大家都往北京跑，交通和环境压力总会有一天会承受不了，那么为什么不能把资源分散或者共享呢。为什么不能让农村的条件也好起来呢？新农村，农民梦……</p>

<p>假如你是总理，你会怎么做……</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>现代人群中痔疮高发，这与生活方式直接相关，如果能够养成健康的生活方式或者知道缓解的办法，可以在很大程度上避免发病和缓解症状。</p>

<h3>痔疮的形成</h3>

<p>在肛管的粘膜下有一层肛管血管垫，简称“肛垫”。起闭合肛管、节制排便作用。正常情况下，肛垫疏松地附着在肛管肌上，排便后借其自身的收缩作用，缩回到肛管内。当弹性回缩作用减弱后，肛垫则充血、下移形成痔。</p>

<h3>导致痔疮的外部原因</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>马桶使用错误<br/>
调查显示城市痔疮发病率要比农村高，究其原因其实是马桶惹得祸。使用马桶时，如果坐姿向后，会使得肛垫受到更大的压力，从而下坠形成痔。缓解的办法是，使用马桶时身体前倾，让腿部帮助承担一定的压力，防护肛垫受力过大。</p></li>
<li><p>久坐和超重<br/>
现代人，特别是白领一族经常久坐在电脑前面，在加上工作压力和体重问题，都是使得痔疮的发病率增加。建议每三十分钟起身一次，适当运动一下。再或者改变坐姿，变坐为站、趟、跪等。另外要避免坐凉凳子。</p></li>
<li><p>擦拭过重</p></li>
<li><p>怀孕和分娩</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>缓解的办法</h3>

<p>当发生痔疮时，如大便出血或者肛垫下垂。缓解的方法包括：<br/>
避免坐凉凳子，冬天使用坐垫。<br/>
每天洗热水澡。<br/>
多吃蔬菜等顺肠食物，防止便秘。<br/>
及时到医院诊断和治疗，防止恶化。</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/11/20/observe-us-science-education</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I visited a AP chemistry class in a high school. I found this class is apparently test driven. The teacher first let the students took a test for 15 minutes. And then coped with students&#8217; individual questions and worksheet related issues. Then he began teach students the rules and tips to get right answers to the test questions. Once a time, a student asked when they would do laboratory. The answer was maybe next week.</p>

<p>The whole class last 90 minutes, which is twice long of class in China. There was a 5-10 minutes break during the class. There about 30 students in the classroom. The topic of this class included Ionic bond,Covalent bond, Polar and non-polar Molecular, Melting point, Atomic properties. The main objective is to learn how to judge which Molecular have higher melting point or stronger bond for the quiz questions. This class was a teacher-dominated class. Teacher used most of the time to lecture the &#8220;powerful&#8221; tips to solve these type of questions. About 20 students seemed listen carefully and 10 students enraged in the conversations by asking questions. Teacher usually addressed students questions immediately sometimes said he would addressed that question later. There were several times students want to ask questions, but the teacher went along with the important tips and principles.</p>

<p>To my surprise, there was a student had nothing to do and lay on the ground listen Mp3. The student said something to the teacher before class, the teacher just let him go. This will never be allowed in Chinese classroom. There are some student hard to like too in China, but mostly they will not put their feet on their desk or sleep on the ground. The teacher will never allow this happen too.</p>

<p>While the teacher also tried to help student understand the principle. He wrote down the Electric force formula on white board. He also used an analogy of 10 toy between boys and girls to explain Polar and non-polar. I am very interested in this representation, it tell me something about the teacher&#8217;s PCK. This representation do help to understand polar and non-polar, the teacher said that think about boys have 5 toy and girls have 5 toy, then it is equal, so in this case the bond is non-polar band. As to polar bond, the teacher let students thought about boys had 7 toy while girls have 3, this polar bond. As to ionic bond, the boy just got all the toys while girls have no toys. But if you think carefully, this representation has fatal limitations and even wrong. First, Electron pair does not &#8220;belong to&#8221; each side but &#8220;shared&#8221;. Second, it is dynamic not static. Third, it is not how many electrons each side have, but how frequently it appears around. While, teacher can use analogies as middle models to help students learn, but it is also necessary to know the limitations of every middle models and move along to the more scientific models.</p>

<p>On my road home, I watched a TED show <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrkrvAUbU9Y">Dan Pink: The puzzle of motivation</a>. The speaker talked about higher motivation(big award) can impede or even kill creativity(e.g. developing new software). I want to say it may be also true in education, while teacher highly motivated to prepare students to get better score, they will decrease the variety of teaching methods until only lecture left. It had happened in China, which may have set a bad example for US.</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/11/20/edu-plan-for-infant</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>教育目的</h3>

<p>很多时候家长不见得重视一岁以内宝宝的教育问题，觉得这个时候谈教育太早了，但实际上家长的一言一行已经暴漏在宝宝的视野当中，只不过这种教育是无意识的教育，也是无目的的教育。不管你是否有心，宝宝时时刻刻都在成长和学习。既然这样，那么为什么不进行有目、有设计的教育呢？</p>

<p>这个阶段的宝宝可以接受感官、运动的训练和情商的教育。为宝宝智力、体力和情商发展打下基础。</p>

<h3>教育活动</h3>

<ol>
<li><p>纸箱子游戏<br/>
给宝宝一个干净结实的纸箱子，宝宝可以在纸箱子里坐下，在纸箱子里放一些玩具，让宝宝进行探索。也可以跟宝宝玩捉迷藏。目的是让宝宝认识空间的概念。</p></li>
<li><p>分类游戏<br/>
可以让宝宝对各种玩具或者食物进行分类，给宝宝一堆物件，然后让宝宝挑选放到不同的盒子里。最好有不同颜色的盒子，分类的方法最好也是多种多样的。目的是让宝宝学会观察区分，同时形成类别的概念。</p></li>
<li><p>堆高楼<br/>
让宝宝把玩具堆在一起，可以是积木，也可以是其他的东西。可能开始的时候宝宝只会搞破坏，把堆好的高楼弄倒，这也是探索重力的过程，后面一点一点的他就学会做不同的动作。比如把一个高楼上东西放到另外一个高楼上。</p></li>
<li><p>找玩具<br/>
当着宝宝的面把玩具藏在被子里面，让宝宝找出来。锻炼宝宝空间记忆的能力。</p></li>
<li><p>玩水<br/>
让宝宝用小勺子把水从一个容器转移到另外一个容器里。理解“空”和“满”的概念。也可以玩“沉”和”浮”。（必须小心看护，防止危险发生）</p></li>
<li><p>情商教育<br/>
宝宝的正常需求是需要及时关照和满足的，比如饿了，尿了，困了等。但是有的时候，比如宝宝特别想要某个玩具，或者明明已经吃饱了还要吃的，这个时候可以延迟满足或者不满足他。延迟满足就是要等宝宝不闹了的时候，再给他想要的，让他知道忍耐和等待，而且并不是一哭就能得到自己想要的东西。</p></li>
</ol>


<p>【安全问题】<br/>
必须有大人看护。<br/>
防止宝宝吞咽、跌倒、异物进入鼻子，保护好眼睛。</p>

<h3>更多游戏：</h3>

<p>模仿动物叫；涂鸦（用有颜色的食物）；和宝宝一来一往（球，爬行，模仿）</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nowardays people spend a lot of time in front of their computer. Most of the time they have to use their eyes whether they are typing or sufing on the internet.</p>

<p>But when you are using computer too much you will find your eyes hurt. Lots of students get short-sighted. A idea come to me, why not close my eye to type in front of a computer. Is it possible, may be ti is possible. So I try to find a sofware to help me to do this job. I find a one, and it works. Now I can sit in front of my computer and keep my eyes closed and typing wha I want to say. Isn&#8217;t it amazing. This software will also help blind peaple to type, because it can sound the key so they can hear what they are typiing.</p>

<p>For me, it just helps to rest my eyes and concentrate on what I am writing.</p>

<p>This is not a new idea, but if is an intersting idea.</p>

<p>The above paragraph is written by me blindly.</p>

<p>Another idea interesting is using your left hand to control the mouse and use your right hand to click. This will help you to coordinate your left brain and right brain.</p>

<p>Now I am using the sound of pinyin to help myslef to type this paragraph. The pinyin sound help to pronounce a word when you are typing. It may not sound very right but it can do give a similar sound of the the word.</p>

<p>Is not it amazing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Topic: Cell structure/Biology<br/>
Designer: <a href="http://zhangchunlei.com/about/">Chunlei Zhang</a><br/>
Student: High school students<br/>
Notes: This is just an imaginary teaching learning scenario sequences.</p>

<p>Imagine a house in your mind(or you can draw it), maybe your family house, maybe not. What does it look like from outside? What about the look of inside? What is the house composed of? What is the function of each part? Can you ask more questions about house?( who made them? which style? what is it made of? how to make a house?) cool!</p>

<p>Today we are going to study cell,similar with house, you can imagine cell as a house for a new strange life. You can ask any questions you want? (list students questions)</p>

<p>Some of your questions, scientists have answered? some question still need further inquiry.</p>

<p>Do you know why scientists study cell?(R or NR) They want to know more about life, an essential question is &#8220;What is life is made of?&#8221; They finally found the answer through a special equipment &#8211; microscope. Their finding suggest that most organism are made of cell. There is a story of discovery of cell.(telling the story)</p>

<p>Cell are usually very very small, and invisible to the naked eye. Do you have any experience of bleeding? What is the color of blood? If you take out of the blood cells, then it looks like this.[picture] What can you infer from this picture? If you look at blood through microscope, then you can see this. These are blood cells. If you look at the blood vessel, you will see this.(video) Not only blood, every parts of your body is made of cells.(student can also draw this conclusion by observing the picture of different tissue are made of different types cells)</p>

<p>Can you guess what is inside of a cell?(Predicted answers: empty, just water or solution, there must be some structures inside)</p>

<p>If we use electron microscope, then we can see the inside structure of the cell. Here is some pictures, try to build a cell structure model as a group. You can number different structures.</p>

<p>When the structures were first discovered by scientist, they also found it hard to communicate, so they name them. Sometime they name them by their characteristics, sometimes using the scientist&#8217;s name. (give the names of different structure) Can you distinguish the different structures inside a cell? Have a try in your group.</p>

<p>Group assessment, show Simulation and let students guess what is the structure and its possible function.</p>

<p>How the different structures relate with each other? We don&#8217;t know. What do you suggest, if you are going to study this research question.</p>

<p>Scientists got these pictures, when they study how proteins are made and transported outside of cells.[three pictures]</p>

<p>What can you see in these pictures? What can you infer? Can you guess or infer the functions of different structures? How do they function together in this process?</p>

<p>Home work: Make a cell structure model that can represent all your group knowledge about cell. We will share and discuss our models on next lesson.</p>

    <link href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/11/15/let-us-do-lecture/"/>
    <updated>2013-11-15T12:49:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/11/15/let-us-do-lecture</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I participated the method class by Dr. Luft and responsed to her question &#8220;How students learn best? by rehearing something, learning the vocabulary, or by doing science&#8221;.</p>

<p>My response was: the answer was obvious doing science will let student learn most, but if we take out of the word &#8220;best&#8221;, all approaches can help student learn in special situations.</p>

<p>I know it is a little misleading and I am afraid that some students in the classroom might misunderstood me. Well, by saying that, I don&#8217;t mean we should really repeat our explanations to students again and again or let students master only vocabularies or terms. But I do want say we should not put &#8216;lecture&#8217; on the opposite side of &#8216;inquiry&#8217;. I also want to point out that we should be very careful to use these two words to label teaching practices, especially those of student teachers.</p>

<p>Well, lecture, You can lecture; Some teacher is only able to lecture. But if you decide to use lecture, try to do it good. Because lecture can be totally different styles and outcomings.</p>

<p>It is interesting &#8211; we did not teach student teachers how to lecture, although this conception exist in their mind, and they are very likely to use this approach in the beginning of their carriers &#8211; isn&#8217;t it.</p>

<p>Ok, let&#8217;s do lecture.(really?)<br/>
There are different levels of lectures.<br/>
1.  Some teacher just stands there and say something, whether related or not. Student are very easily lost interests and get boring and then sleeping. Sometime they appear awake, but their mind are sleep.<br/>
2.  Some teacher stand there say something interesting, student are engaged and listen carefully, some can even retell the interesting stories to others. It is better, right.<br/>
3.  Some stand there say something putting students on uncomfortable positions, let students think critically about the dilemma or issues and discuss with each other, which may have a profound impact on what students believe and act in the future.</p>

<p>Some lecturer also do some performance or something tricky or funny; Some lecture even let audience participate, here is a example of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZGY0wPAnus">TED lecture: the art of misdirection</a>. Whether lecture or inquiry, they are just labels. Label itself can not guarantee your teaching quality and students&#8217; learning outcomes. We should keep this in mind.</p>

<p>In fact, what teachers can do and only do is create learning opportunity by engaging student in learning activities. Student learn new knowledge through their learning experience. But, different learning experience have different consequences. The following is the learning pyriod.<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/learningpyramid.png" alt="learning pyramid" /></p>

<p>You can see from the picture above, student can sit and listen, learn by listening and reading. This process just get information into their short term memory not long term memory. So they may just listen and forget, rarely transfer the new knowledge into new situations.</p>

<p>They can also study by doing science,trying to figure out questions such as what can I do with this stuff ? How to relate all these stuff? What data to collect? How to collect? What is happening? What is going to happen? Why it happen? Why it doesn&#8217;t happen? and so on. This approach not only work on the working memory, but also interact with the long term memory &#8211; their prior ideas and conceptual frameworks. They have to recall what they had learned and experienced in order to solve all these problems.</p>

<p>In the learning pyramid, the most effective way is learning by teaching,just as what the student teacher are doing now. Usually we suppose student teachers already have enough content knowledge for teaching the topic, but it is not true. Many studies showed that beginning teachers&#8217; content knowledge are usually Fragmented and less connected, it was also structured for doing test not teaching.<a href="#1">1</a> Maybe it is enough for exam but not enough for teaching.</p>

<p>Inquiry research showed that good inquiry are significantly better than lecture, but it has a precondition &#8211; the teacher have good knowledge ground.<a href="#2">2</a> Carlsen (1991) reported that when teaching self-identified high knowledge topics, teacher were more likely to ask more high level questions than teaching low knowledge topics.<a href="#3">3</a> But student teachers usually lack of this ground, they are struggling with integrating inquiry into their lessons. It is not an easy thing achieved overnight, but a step by step continuing process.</p>

<p>Recently, I read a book review <a href="http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108010/chapters/Learning,-or-Not-Learning,-in-School.aspx">Learning,or not Learning,in school</a>. The author of the book argued teacher can not give a model or demonstration, and then let student follow the model to do on their own(the mistake I also made in my teaching). There should be some middle stages, such as discussing or doing together or let students do it collaborative, before let them do it by their own. The big idea is Gradually ownership shifting, or gradual release of responsibility. It is not a new idea, but I like it.<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/learningshift.png" alt="learning shift" /><br/>
This picture is from: <a href="http://www.ascd.org/publications/books/108010/chapters/Learning,-or-Not-Learning,-in-School.aspx">Learning,or not Learning,in school</a></p>

<p>As you can see in the picture, the middles stages Guided Instruction(we do it) and Collaborative(you do it together) sometimes is missing our teaching. This may explain why students can&#8217;t do it well as teacher expected, because the learning process is too sharp.</p>

<p>Why I want to highlight the point that DO NOT put lecture in the opposite position of Inquiry, I have other concerns. Try to think:<br/>
What happen if student teacher believe in inquiry but can not do it well?<br/>
==>They drop out. Because they tend to believe themselves not suitable for teaching.</p>

<p>Another extreme concern is:<br/>
What happen if teacher only believe lecture and only one direction approach?<br/>
==>They refuse to change and can&#8217;t do a good job,finally they may drop out.</p>

<p>Usually, student teacher know they should do inquiry or make their class more interactive, but they are just not able to do it or feel too hard to do it. Why this happen? What to do with this? If this doesn&#8217;t change, they will form a belief that inquiry doesn&#8217;t suit them or their teaching. It is a hot potato. Well one possible approach to this problem is &#8220;we do it together&#8221;.</p>

<p>We were taught to not label students, right? We also should avoid to label teachers. Abused labels can cause problems even disasters, for example, students who labeled themselves as visual learner would say, I can&#8217;t learn very well because the teacher used very little pictures, simulations. Really? In fact, the label just limit students&#8217; learning approaches instead of expand their ways of learning. Good learner should use every possible way to learn and develop skills respectively.</p>

<p>Who should take the responsibility for learning? Teacher? Students? Or both? Or the responsibility gradually shift from teacher to students?</p>

<p>What strategies or methods are suitable for this shifting?</p>

<p>These are the questions that are worth to think over.</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/11/14/assess-for-learning</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I went to a the seminar <a href="http://www.ctl.uga.edu/node/486">Teaching and Assessing so Your Students Learn More: Maximizing Learning-Centered Pedagogy</a> by Dr. Phyllis Blumberg.</p>

<p>We did some interactive activities,such as drawing a picture of learning-centered teaching, think and discuss, group disscussion of a special topic and report. I attended the discussion of how to use assessment to promote students&#8217; learning with 6 people.</p>

<p>Although most participants are college faculties, but when assigned to group work, some tend to speak more than the others, unaware of someone not speaking a word. I want to rearrange the process by divided into two small groups, but I feel hard to interupt and unsure which way will work better. Athough we do discussed sometimes one student dominates the group work and coversation, some people are too shy to say anything. You see, sometimes people say it but not do it and even unaware of this inconsistence.</p>

<p>There are various assessments that can be used for different purposes.<br/>
Before class you can give students questiong to guide their reading and explore their prior ideas.</p>

<pre><code>multiple choice question  
guiding questions  
open questions  
Dilemma  
Senario  
judgement  
</code></pre>

<p>In class, you can give student short quiz to know if students get the point of if they are able to apply them.</p>

<pre><code>Clicker  
Online analysis  
Open questions and discussion  
short quiz  
Drawing      
</code></pre>

<p>After class, assignments can help students review, exercise and enhance what they learned.</p>

<pre><code>Online assessment  
observation  
hand-on  
Reading  
Design  
Problem soving  
exercise  
learning activities judgement and improvement  
</code></pre>

<p>Final exam can report students&#8217; acheivement.</p>

<pre><code>interview(when there are only several students, this would be a good choice)  
project(which let student really take the ownership)  
write a paper/story  
design  
make vedio/prezi  
oral presentation/defence  
Fair or competition  
Paper exam  
</code></pre>

<p>Why learning is dangerous? Because when are learning you have to change&#8211;habits, beliefs,knowledge,actions and so on, every change may let you sit in an uncomfortable place unsure of the following consequence.</p>

<p>But not learning is lethal. Because the world change in every minutes, even every seconds, if you act the same way as before, you will be very likely lost your job, get a stroke and worry about your food and Pension.</p>

<p>What to do then?</p>

<p>Learn with a teacher, learn with your friends and learn in your own feasible and effective ways. Of course you have to study how learning happen to you at first.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I went to MLC to attend a lecture by Dr Michelle Smith. In front of MLC, I saw a strange thing. You can see the picture below.
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/hungeru.png" alt="hungeru" /></p>

<p>The fact and statistics is printed on it. Food still occupy a large percentage(39.8%) in their total household spend. In Congo, 70% goes to food, it means people there are more likely in hunger.</p>

<p>I asked where is the data from? They told me they gathered these data last Saturday, and the survey is still going on.</p>

<p>How can I participate? I asked. Just let people know this fact and then we can change this fact and statistic. Isn&#8217;t it a good idea? College students may not give money directly, but they can collect data and spread the fact all over the world.</p>

<p>Although the program is funded by Farm Journal Foundation, I guess volunteer college students played a role in the Survey and HungerU Tour in different countries. This is the responsibility that our college students are able to and should shoulder.</p>

In fact I met this problem several times before, I know it is caused by the graphic driver update. I have to reinstall the right driver. But I forget where is the driver file and how to setup it.</p>

<p>I tried many times and finially I got it back to normal. The solving process:</p>

<pre><code>#login with your username and password
cd Downloads # where my dirver is
sudo sh amd-driver-64.run
setup it (always select the first selection and ok)
#restart
</code></pre>

<p>I have copied the driver in the folder dirver. so next time I can found it more easily.</p>

<p>The problem I have to solve:<br/>
1.  How to stop the update for the graphic driver?<br/>
2.  How to recover my ubuntu quickly?</p>
