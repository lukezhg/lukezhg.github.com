    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>在学习和借鉴别国教育经验的时候，我们往往容易摆错心态。一种是自满，觉得学不学无所谓，别国的教育理念和实践也好不到哪去。另外一种是奉为神明，觉得一切都是好的，都要搬过来。然后一谈到本土的教育，觉得很自卑。其实这两种太多都过于偏激，都不可取。</p>

<p>其实出现这种情况，也在一定程度上反映了我们缺乏全方位深度思考的能力，这是灌输式教育很难教出来的。</p>

<p>其实对于一线教师而言，看看别人的课堂，别校的课堂，别国的课堂，是非常好的第一步，这意味着你在尝试改变和探寻。观看别人的课堂目的并不是照搬别人的课堂，但它们至少会告诉你，什么样的课堂是可能的。接下来思考，在你的控制范围内，你能让它在多大程度上发生，如何设计你的课堂，在实践中有用的留下，不好用的改进，没用的舍弃。这是一个一线教师能够做的，至少能让自己班上的孩子们保留一丝对自然科学的向往。这就是一线教师值得骄傲的。至于教育系统的问题，多半责任在教育决策者和研究者身上，而且问题不可能一下子解决。学习和研究别人的东西没什么丢人的，不学习才可耻。孔子说“三人行，必有我师”，人家美国都喊出“超越上海”的口号了，我们观摩观摩别国的课堂，研究研究他们的套路，有什么可自卑的。当然学习不是迷信，研究不是照搬。</p>

<p>自满和自卑其实都是学习的敌人。而在今天，不学习是必然要落后的，即便曾经强盛过。</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/08/25/why-we-teach-science-in-school-and-how</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Why</h3>

<p>It is important for students to survive in such an era full of science and technology products and information.<br/>
It is also important for a country to have enough science literate talents and labors in order to survive in the global economy.<br/>
Why science important? You can go on reading another blog post<a href="http://www.letstalkscience.ca/about-us/why-science">Why science?</a></p>

<h3>We</h3>

<p>Science teacher is a career but also a job. They are playing the most important role in developing the science literacy of the next generation. We choose it and we do it.</p>

<h3>Teach</h3>

<p>Good teaching is not an accident. It is a pursely planed activity fiting students&#8217; needs and level.</p>

<h3>Science</h3>

<p>Authentic science not just includ scientific knowledge(facts, concepts, theories), but also the process of science and the nature of science.</p>

<h3>In school</h3>

<p>While school education system is still the dominant formal learning place today. So it is an crutial battle feild of science education. But science learning can happen anywhere not just in school.</p>

<h3>Why has science teaching changed over time?</h3>

<p>Science is changing everyday. New discovery, New papers, New theories and models, in fact science update itself everyday.<br/>
Student is changing every year. Students today are not like before. They have iphone, ipad, facebook. Even kids at the same age in different class response significant differently to the same question.<br/>
Society is changing too. It need more talents who are good at 4Cs: Communication, Collaboration, Critical thinking and Creativity.<br/>
Should science teaching keep the same as before? Never.</p>

<h3>How should science be taught in science classrooms?</h3>

<p>Well, It is really a hard question.</p>

    <updated>2013-08-25T21:08:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/08/25/surpassing-shanghai</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>最近在QQ论坛里，有同学提到这本书《超越上海：美国应该如何建设世界顶尖的教育系统》。这个标题容易给人一种误解，以为中国的教育已经在美国前头了，这绝对是错误的理解。<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/Surpassing-Shanghai.jpg" alt="Surpassing Shanghai" /><br/>
其实美国人的危机意识很强烈，从《A nation at risk》到《No child left behind》都显示了国家对教育的重视，特别是科学教育，其实大家去查一查各国的教育财政预算比例就清楚了。之所以很多美国学者喊狼来了，道理很简单，第一是危机意识，第二，为了获得更多关注、科研项目和财政支持。这种危机意识是这个国家保持全球第一的重要条件。</p>

<p>其实简单的说美国教育好或者中国教育好是没有意义的，另外上海的pisa成绩根本代表不了中国，大家闭着眼睛想一想自己家乡的教育状况就心中有数了。</p>

<p>另外再看看我们学生高考完的表现，焚书啊！你说教育取得了多少成绩，我说很惨，没有发自内心的热爱，一票否决。</p>

<p>最近看了Timss的几个课堂视频，强列推荐大家看看，特别是日本的中学科学课堂。大家可以自己比一比，想一想。<a href="http://timssvideo.com/72">Timssvideo-Japan-Physics</a></p>

<p>千万不要被上海的pisa成绩或者这本书的标题蒙骗了，要想想样本的代表性以及作者的立场。说到科学教育，中国科学教育者还有很长的一段路要走。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>花了整整一天的时间才把信息技术和专业英语的作业、论文以及学习总结看完。我觉得挺享受这个过程的，每一个英语小论文都是一个故事，一个实实在在奋斗和挣扎在一线岗位青年教师的故事，真心希望大家也能相互彼此阅读，看看其他同学经历的，收获的，付出的，还有抉择。另外大家的学习总结也让我对课程进行了重新的审视和反思，同学们提了很好的意见，有鼓励，也有批评，这些都是我做未来课程计划的重要依据，这点我很看重。我也会加倍努力！</p>

<p>有的时候只有从一个环境中走出来，才能更好的审视自己，不知道你们是否有同感。教师这一行要求我们必须保持开放的心态，接受你的学生，接纳新的技术，新的思想，新的策略。如果一下接受不了那么多，那么可以从一点点做起。上课的时候我们同学使用了prezi,现在我也开始使用prezi来，而且越用越好用了，这就是开放的心态，尝试的心态，遇到新东西，不是说no，而应该向老外学习说why not。我觉得作为教师，没有哪一点比这更重要了。走出来，不仅仅空间，更是思考方式和观念。愿我们都能永远具有敞开来、走出去的勇气和信念。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I went to the Main library of UGA. I had a task to search a journal from 1980 to 1990. It was my first time to be there. To my suprise, nobody stopped me to check my UGA card. So I just went around and check out the journels. It means everybody can come in and take a seat to read. It is great! The frist floor is very big and open. The book and magzines are located in the center, surrounded by many groups of tables, seats and computers. Although many students studying there, it was very quiet. I ask a library staff how to find the journal, he helped me to check it out in his computer and told me it is located at the second floor and it is also available online. So I just came out. It was at the noon, I took a picture of the main library, it is beautiful. <br/>

<p>
I also found some interesting things at Aderhold where College of Education located. The first thing was the emergency chair at the corner of stairwell. You can break the window and use the chair to take somebody hurt going downstairs. What a considerate safety concern! You can find an emergency shower at every classroom, which hardly seen in Chinese classroom.<br/>

<p>When I entered the building in the morning, I found there were lots of names on the bricks. I guess there are the names of professors who had worked there. <br/>

<p>When I kept looking, I saw a brick which said: &#8220;stop read the bricks, go to study&#8221;. I smiled and entered the building.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes it is hard to let students collect data to test their ideas about nature. For example to make observations how stars move for a long time, or do experiment about why plant grow to the sunlight. In this case, when oboservation and experiment difficult to carry out in classroom, computer software or interactive simulations can help a lot. There are two examples.</p>

<p>In a middle school biology class, students can play with the following flash game to figure out why plant grow to the sun.</p>

<p>Interactive simulations can help:<br/>
-   enage students, just give a cool show and some questions, then let them play with it.
-   stimulate students to ask questions
-   make observations and collect data or evidences<br/>
-   test their ideas</p>

<p>If teachers can guide and organize them to make explainations or argue with each other based on evidence, and make predictions and test them, at last provide opportunities for self-evaluation and community evaluations, then this approach would be more effective for learning science in classroom.</p>

If you have more good modeling activities, welcome recommandations.</p>

<p>These activities provide lots of practice options for science teachers. We usually only provide standards of what students should master but little practice activites for teachers. Well, the <a href="http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards">Next Generation Standard</a> is going to change this.</p>

<p>Reflections on Modeling in science teaching<br/>
The charm of modeling:<br/>
-   Naturally need students to make careful observation,recording data,drawing conclusions<br/>
-   Naturally engage students&#8217; prior ideas for explaination or application<br/>
-   Naturally put students into the test, debate and revisement of their models or prior ideas<br/>
-   Naturally let students experience the full process of science inquiry and nature of science</p>

<p>What to focus in the modeling activites as a science teacher?</p>

<p>How to keep the balance between knowledge-centered and student-centered? Individual and Community? Cognition and metacognition?</p>

<p>Welcome to join the discussion of these open questions!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A good teacher just like a good cook. Of course, you can tell a good cook by the taste of his dishes. So students&#8217; perfect performance is a good predictor of competent teacher. But it takes a lot effort to make the dishes OR evaluate the students. In fact, we can also tell a good cook by his preparation and operation of his cooking.  Good cook can aways make many dishes in a limited time. Because he don&#8217;t stop, when heating the water, he is washing the vegatables or cutting the meat. When the water is ready he is also ready to fry them together. The teacher do the same thing in class expecially in a short class. I found this metaphor visiting Dr C&#8217;s class, she give instructions as well as preparing the tools for modeling, at the same time she was also doing demonstration of what the secret tube behaviors.</p>

<p>Sometimes science teacher educators complain that teachers&#8217; beliefs are stubborn and reluctant to change their practices. Well, It is true.</p>

<p>The science teacher is like a swimming player in a swimming poor. The science teacher educator stand beside and tell the player how to swim, which style is good which is bad. But the most important thing for a person in the swimming poor is to keep safty and the most reliable style is his primary style. How can we blame them not trying to change, if their safty is not guaranteed and skills not developed.</p>

<p>As a science teacher educator, you can not stand by but jump into the swimming poor and provide necessary skills and safety.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is my first time to view a science classroom teaching in Japan. In fact, it supprise me a little. I know the science education in Japan is of high quality. They get much better score than the other counties and teacher are respectable profession. But I never thought the classroom are so interactive and effective. You can click <a href="http://timssvideo.com/72">here</a> to view the video.</p>

<blockquote><p>This eighth-grade science lesson is about the formation of clouds. It is the third lesson in a sequence of 19 lessons on weather. The lesson is 53 minutes in duration. There are 25 students in the class.<br/>
<video width='720' height='480' preload='none' controls poster=' https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/timssvideo.png'><source src='http://timssvid1.s3.amazonaws.com/JP5%20Air%20compression%20and%20expansion.mp4' type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'/></video></p></blockquote>

<p>Here is my record of the time usage of the class:</p>

<blockquote><p>00-03 review what learnt<br/>
03-07 demistration<br/>
07-17 demistration of key skills for today&#8217;s experiment<br/>
18-36 Student activites(4 experiments and group take turn)<br/>
36-50 sumary of experiment result and draw conclusion<br/>
50-52 self-evalation</p></blockquote>

<p>I watched the video twice, first I just got a glance of it very quickly. The second time, I watch it very carefully and make notes of what teacher and students were doing.</p>

<p>First, I found a very interesting thing that the Japenese teacher used about 17 minutes to engage students and make demonstration at the begining. He also used about 17 minutes to sumary the results and conclusions at the end of the class. Acording to psychology studies, people are most likely to remember what happened at begining and at the end. People usually can only concentrate for 15 minutes. So most TED videos will not last more than 17 minutes. I don&#8217;t know if the teacher did it popurely. But he did it really well.</p>

<p>Second, the class is very interesting and vigorous. Students really had fun with the activities and record and try to explain.</p>

<p>Third, it keep a good balance of knowledge-centered and student-centered. The most important ideas and inquiry skills were embodied in student activities.</p>

<p>At last, I want to say although the teacher said nothing about modeling. But he raised a question for students to study.  Students want to explain but had little idea and experieces. So they did the activities that teacher prepared for them. Before experiments, they make their explannation and predictions, they recorded the result on the handouts, they have to revise their explanation and building a more powerful causal model to explain all the phenomenons. So we do can found the shape of modeling in this class.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the most deep impressions I got of US is the pursuing of simple and comfortable life.</p>

<p>First is the bus design.<br/>
There is a button out side of the bus that customers can push to kneel the bus. Another design is that there is a string along the windows. You can pull the string to let bus stop. You don&#8217;t even need to stand up.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing I discovered the yellow alert along the road. First I though it is to let people wark accross the street. But when I look into it carefully, It said &#8220;State law: stop when human on the line&#8221;, it is for the car. No wonder evertime when I was on the line, the drive will stop let me pass first. What a nice law!  <br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/statelaw.jpg" alt="Statelaw" /><br/>
One day, when I was on my way home from supermarket, I found there is an American Bank ATM special for car drivers near the shops. I have never saw such ATM before in China. You don&#8217;t have to get out of your car when you using the ATM In China, when you go to banks, usually you have wait for half an hour to get your turns in Shanghai. Why it is so different! This is a really good question to think about.</p>

<p>The last discovery is kitchen. They have kitchen not only in the apartment where I live but also in the office. There is a special kitchen room for professors and students to heat their lunch or make coffee. So nice!<br/>
Oh, I nearly forget. The water ﻿purifier﻿. It is so cool and useful, I love it too much.<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/water.jpg" alt="water purifier" /></p>

<p>It is evident that the goal of American people is to pursue a simple and comfortable life. Maybe not very luxurious but comfortable.</p>

<p>How did they achieve that, market and competition may be the driving power. What it doesn&#8217;t happen in China? Big question!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you want to run away confronting a challenge. Usually, you have your own reasons. It is too hard. It is too boring. I am not good at this. It is so painful. You want to advoid to meet it although it is important and urgent. We all know it but feel so hard to control yourself.</p>

<p>So what to do?</p>

<p>YOU have an imaginary enemy to fight. Game start! Sometimes your enemy is strong and sometimes he is endurable. Mostly, you have exaggerated your enemy and belittled yourself. Imagine you are fighting against an enemy who also have his own weakness. The wise move would be found his weakness and take all the advantage you have to beat him. If you don&#8217;t fight, you are doomed to failure. If you fight, there still a hope to win.</p>

<p>In fact, you have no opotions but to fight. Your imaginary enemy would alert you and help you to beat the fearness and win the game!</p>
