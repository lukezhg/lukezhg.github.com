    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is an assignment of Dr. Oliver&#8217;s class ESCI7040(teaching strategies). The goal of this activity is to reflect on my own teaching and modify the plans for future teaching.</p>

<p>I taught learning theories to undergraduates in order to let them make sense of how students learn and apply these principles in their future teaching.</p>

<p>The guiding question is what is knowledge and how people learn? The big ideas include:<br/>
1. Different type of knowledge play different roles and people learn them differently.<br/>
2. Learning Science is not just learning scientific knowledge but also science practice and the nature of science.<br/>
3. Teacher need various types of knowledge to help students learn science.<br/>
4. Different learning theories understand people&#8217;s learning differently and give different suggestions for teaching and learning.<br/>
5. Preconceptions, learning styles, learning strategies play an important role in students&#8217; learning.</p>

<p>This lesson takes 90 minutes and during 60 minutes I was lecturing.</p>

<h3>Task1: Reflections of this lesson:</h3>

<p>1 Wether the content of this lesson can effectively help them understand how students learn science and apply these principles in their teaching?<br/>
Some ideas are too general and loosely related. They should be deleted or modified.<br/>
You should focus more on students&#8217; learning not teachers&#8217; learning<br/>
Don&#8217;t try to cover every learning theories, teach the most important one and the crucial strategies or tools.<br/>
You may also included some brain-based learning studies such as how learning occur and what factors may affect learning.<br/>
Conceptual change should be included in this lesson.<br/>
2 Are these goals/objectives appropriate for your students?<br/>
These goals are not challenging enough for undergraduates. More critical thinking and challenging tasks should be used in this lesson.<br/>
You can try to related your teaching methods with learning principles and invite students to think both in the role of learners and teacher(your role).</p>

<p>3 How were the goals/objectives appropriate for the course in which the unit was taught?<br/>
I found that I simply followed the sequence of the textbook. I may first teach this lesson &#8216;learning theory&#8217; (Chapter 4) and then teach &#8216;teaching strategies&#8217;(Chapter 3). Students should first know how leaning happen and then learn how to teach.</p>

<p>4 How the instructional strategies adequate for the learning you hoped would happen?<br/>
Lecture should be more interactive(share learning experience of yours or students, thinking aloud, student teaching), include more student-centered activities (sorting learning tasks, diagnosing students&#8217; learning difficulties, think-pair-share, one minute writing, interpret teaching clips).</p>

<p>5 How were the assessments&#8211;either formal or informal&#8211;adequate(and valid and reliable) for the task of assessing student learning?<br/>
There are two assessments: A1 explain Osmosis to high school students; A2 design a 5E lesson plan. A1 is an informal assessment on class. A2 seems not closely related with this lesson. A better assignment would be study students&#8217; preconceptions about one topic and design an activity to elicit students prior ideas.</p>

<h3>Task 2 redesign:</h3>

<h4>The big ideas that student should understand:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Learners build their knowledge on their prior knowledge collaboratively in special social context or situations.</li>
<li>Learning occur when connections are made in Neural Networks or social networks.</li>
<li>Well designed physical and social learning environment help students learn by improving their brains&#8217; function.</li>
<li>Prior ideas, emotion, metacogniton play crucial roles in students&#8217; science learning.</li>
<li>Different learning strategies suit for different learning tasks; Some tasks are more difficult than others; Student percept learning tasks differently.</li>
</ol>


<h4>The skills that student should develop:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Elicit and engage students&#8217; prior ideas of a core concept.</li>
<li>Diagnosis students&#8217; difficulties in learning a concept.</li>
<li>Design or redesign classroom learning environment to optimize students&#8217; learning.</li>
<li>Select proper learning strategies for special learning tasks.</li>
<li>Summary learning research results and its implications for teaching.</li>
</ol>


<h4>The interactive lecture and student activites:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Share personal learining stragegy (Chemical equilibrium)</li>
<li>Ask a student to thinking aloud</li>
<li>Student teaching one screen</li>
<li>sorting learning tasks</li>
<li>diagnosing students&#8217; learning difficulties in a teaching clip</li>
<li>think-pair-share</li>
<li>one minute writing</li>
</ol>


<h3>Task 3 reflect on why you change:</h3>

<p>My previous purpose is follow and cover the most important content both on the textbook and in my vision. I spent a lot of time on how to represent these content to students but did not pay too much attention to how these content serve the goal of this course. At that time, I did not have many activities to choose from and had to create my own one by one. I also had limited knowledge of how students learn science before, now I know more. So I want to include the more important ideas that I know and get rid of un important or unrelated ideas.</p>

<p>Although I believed that I should use more student-centered activities, but I just didn&#8217;t have them. It took time for me to gather, test, accumulate related activities or ideas. My enriched learning experiences and pedagogical thinking also help me to generate new activities that probably work for my students.</p>

<p>Recently, I read some papers and books about evidence-based teaching and brain-based learning, they also encourage me to select the core ideas and activities for my teaching plan.</p>

<p>Conclusion: If you want to improve your teaching practice, you need to know more about the content, more about your students, more about what you can possibly do and use in your class. Of course, you also have to know what student really learn and why they do so.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a happy time of lunch, Julie drive us to see a tree that owns itself. It took us only several minutes to get there from the Grit.</p>

<p>Here is the picture of the tree.<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/tree-owns-itself.png" alt="Tree owns itself" /></p>

<p>The owner of the nearby house loved this tree too much, he wanted to protect the tree as long as possible. So he claimed that he conveyed the right of this tree and nearby land to this tree itself.</p>

<p>The view of values of Americans are well presented in the story of this tree. They love and respect nature and the natural organism. They also respect and trust laws. There are more willing to share and respect other peoples&#8217; love and willings.</p>

<p>This cultural values may answer at least partly the questions: why the sky is still blue and the water is still clean; why birds sing in the morning and squallers run around; why people like to go nature for holiday and spend more money to buy green electricity.</p>

<p>This may be the big thing that China lacks and we want to rebuild, in both Chinese culture and education system.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Oliver let us read this following paper and write one or two paragraph of summary.<br/>
Nuthall, G. (2004). Relating Classroom Teaching to Student Learning: A Critical Analysis of Why Research Has Failed to Bridge the Theory-Practice Gap. Harvard Educational Review, 74(3), 273–307.</p>

<p>It is good paper to read, although it is a little long for non-native English speaker.</p>

<p>Here is what I got:</p>

<p>It matters how teacher look at and use educational research.<br/>
Is this why western culture emphase qualitative studies than quantitative studies?<br/>
The precondition of this approach is that teacher education help teachers do so. So it should be one topic in teacher education program.<br/>
why research necessary for teacher development<br/>
what research questions are more hard to know by only practicing<br/>
What relationship existes between teaching and learning</p>

<p>Why educational research is necessary:<br/>
1 teacher hard to see learning evidence (only some students)<br/>
2 reseach can help identify teachers&#8217; tacit beliefs and limitations<br/>
3 learning in students&#8217; mind are not easy to see by teachers where research should help.</p>

<p>learning is an inner process that can not easily seen<br/>
Research should help teacher see this process</p>

<p>Teachers need an explanatory theory of the teaching-learning relationship that meets these
requirements in order to plan, carry out, and evaluate their daily activi- ties effectively and efficiently(Floden, 2001; Levin &amp; ODonnell, 1999).</p>

<p>Teachers usually take teaching-learning consequence for granted and when it don&#8217;t it is student to blame.</p>

<p>Classroom 3 layers:<br/>
visible activities and behaviors<br/>
semi-visible stu-stu<br/>
semivisible individual stu</p>

<p>what role student-private-talk play in student learning(online learning sometimes is the case when learners do not interact with peers.)</p>

<p>understanding how teaching is related to learning requires an understanding of:<br/>
1. teacher influence<br/>
2. sociocultural influence<br/>
3. student make sense of their classroom experience</p>

<p>a theory of effective teaching is still needed in order to know when to look and what to look for when you observe the teachers classroom activities.</p>

<p>Best of these studies had two enormous advantages over previous research:<br/>
First, they were based on systematic observation or audio- and video-recording of teacher and student behavior. Second, independent measures of student learning that were directly related to the student experi- ences being observed were used in almost all of the best studies.</p>

<p>Teachers themselves are not always good at rating student achievement, as their ratings tend to be strongly affected by student behavior and motivation, crediting the most attentive and interested with higher achievement (Gold- enberg, Gallimore, Reese, &amp; Garnier, 2001)</p>

<p>The problem of process-product studies or careless quantitative studies is neglecting the context and other students out of</p>

<p>The study, however, is of little use in advancing our knowledge about the teaching-learning relationship</p>

<p>I have already made the point that teachers cannot be aware of critical elements in the
teaching-learning process in their own classrooms unless they already have a clear understanding of what to look for and have additional ways of observing or recording the experiences of individual students.</p>

<p>If you simply looked at the post-test totals, you would incorrectly assume that the more able learned more than the less able.</p>

<p>But it cannot produce generalizable knowledge (or an evi- dence based explanatory theory) of the relationships between the alternative versions of the visible structure and the basis model (to use Oser and Baeriswyls model) that can be transferred from classroom to classroom.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that how students learn and how their learning is shaped by the actions of the teacher is always unique and context dependent (Barab &amp; Kirschner, 2001; Bolster, 1983). This claim is both true and not true.</p>

<p>Part of the professional knowledge of teachers must be the distinction between what is unique to a specific context and what is generalizable across all students and/or contexts. While the latter is the proper focus of research on the teaching-learning relationship, an adequate explanatory theory should help us to distinguish between the two.</p>

<p>individual case studies of teaching, provided they include data about student experience and learning that can be directly connected to observations of specific classroom activities, can provide invaluable insights into the processes that lie behind the teaching-learning relationship.(baby project)</p>

<p>I believe that the professional knowledge base that is most needed to improve the quality of teaching and teacher education is knowledge about the ways in which classroom activities, including teaching, affect the changes taking place in the minds of students: what students know and believe and what they can do with their knowledge (what I have called above practical explanatory theory). At the heart of the problem that teachers face in the classroom is knowing what is going on in the minds of the students (Steffe, Thompson, &amp; von Glasersfeld, 2000).</p>

<p>Suggestions for future studies:<br/>
1. Independent in-depth assessment of what students learn.<br/>
2. Complete, continuous data on individual student experience.<br/>
3. Complete, continuous data on classroom activities.<br/>
4. Analysis based on the continuous connections among classroom activities, student experiences, and learning processes.<br/>
5. Avoid the aggregation of data.<br/>
6. Explanatory theory must be directly and transparently connected to relevant evidence.</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2014/06/07/discuss-education-reform</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>教育改革是关系到千家万户的事，不仅仅涉及到教育官员、政策制定者、专家学者，还涉及到普通的教师、家长、学生和教育研究工作者，什么人都可以对教育说上一两句的。我也打算说上一两句。</p>

<p>关于素质教育和应试教育的争论由来已久，最近又有一场争论。列文如下：<br/>
正方：<a href="http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_538c514e0101f3bm.html">王策三：应该尽力尽责总结经验教训——评“十年课改：超越成败与否的简单评价”</a><br/>
反方：<a href="http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_492471c80102e77a.html">杨东平：新课程改革的得失和深化——兼与王策三教授交流</a></p>

<p>争论的导火索是一篇报道：<a href="http://edu.people.com.cn/GB/15911286.html">十年课改：超越成败与否的简单评价&#8211;人民网</a></p>

<p>报道的内容是“教师对新课改的评价”的网络调查结果，该调查由21世纪教育研究院等机构组织实施，近4000名中小学教师接受了抽样问卷调查。受调查教师覆盖了全国29个省、自治区、直辖市的城乡各级教师。（见正方文章）</p>

<p>强烈建议读者先把两篇文章比较着来读，可以兼顾和权衡，对于正确对待课程改革会很有帮助。</p>

<p>因为调查结果明确显示了教师对课程改革不满（表现在总体评价75%不满意；73%认为知识体系不系统；47%认为学生课业负担反而加重了），所以争论的关键并不是课程改革的成败。而是如何解释这个调查结果以及如何面对的课改问题。</p>

<p>正方的观点是：这个调查明确显示了课改的失败，而“超越成败”有逃避责任之嫌，当务之急是要总结经验教训，避免对立素质教育和应试教育，停止“覆灭”“应试教育”这个口号和目标，回到“学科课程”为主“经验课程”为辅的正常轨道上来，依照科学的工作方法逐步改善片面应试的弊端，而不是另起炉灶。</p>

<p>反方的观点是：观念的胜利本身就是一个巨大的成就，它是教育范式转变的前提。以杜郎口中学为代表的农村学校“学生主体课堂”是改革的一朵奇葩。今后，一是在打破“教师中心”之后，继续打破“教材中心”、“课堂中心”，走向以儿童为中心的生活教育。二是简政放权、改革中小学办学体制，促进教育家办学，使自下而上的“星星之火”得以燎原。</p>

<p>两方提出的措施都有可取的地方自然不必细说。但是对于课程改革的成败与否和未来走向，他们的观点是完全不同的。正方在说你看，教师最有发言权，这十年的课改是不成功的，不承认也得承认，考试和学科课程本身并没有错，是我们需要理性回归的正路，只是我们需要想办法改善其某些弊端罢了，决不能完全抛弃它们。</p>

<p>反方则认为，改革也不是一点都不成功，教学观念的转变不就成绩吗？另外杜郎口模式也很有潜力，只要有更好的政策，其“星星之后”可以燎原的。改革的根本方向并没错，当然还是要坚持走下去。</p>

<p>这里面，有几个问题值得讨论和思考：<br/>
关于观念的胜利<br/>
1. 教学观念的转变到底算不算课程改革的成绩呢？教师的教学观念真的转变了吗？<br/>
2. 改革进程中，教学观念的转变是怎样发生的？是自发的？还是被挟持的？稳定与否？<br/>
关于调查结果的解释<br/>
3. 这个调查结果究竟应该如何解释？做出怎样的结论才是恰当的？（不大不小）<br/>
4. 如果想全面评估课程改革取得的实质性进展，那么应该做这个评估？应该收集哪些数据？<br/>
关于今后的路该如何走<br/>
5. 未来的教育改革走向究竟应该如何走？这样大的决策应该依据什么做出？<br/>
6. 究竟是专家引领的自上而下的改革适合中国，还是在大的政策框架下自下而上星火燎原适合中国？各有哪些利弊？</p>

<p>课程改革反思应该遵循的原则：<br/>
1. 不要只看结果，要分析产生结果的原因。<br/>
2. 不要推卸责任，要认真负责、实事求是、认清问题。<br/>
3. 不要太主观化、运动化、意愿化、敌对化，要基于实证研究结果和国情做出决策，求准不求快。</p>

<p>其实这场论战早就开始了，细看其中的参考文献就知道了。能听的进去别人不同的意见，才了不起。毕竟是为公不为私。其实课程改革的团队恰恰需要不同的声音，决策者应该将不同声音都纳入到重大决策的制定和执行团队中，不辨不明。协商下的妥协要胜过一边倒的绝对胜利式的决策。</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2014/05/30/pick-the-right-test</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>You have to pick a test to analysis your data. The question is which test is the right one. Well, it depends on your data and your hypothesis. Usually there are lot of choices, but only one solves your problem best.</p>

<p>Here are some suggestions for selecting test by the types of your variables.<br/>
Dependent and Independent Variables<br/>
Dependent Variable(DV) is what you are care of. Independent Variable(IV) is what you think may affect your dependent variable. Usually you can control your independent variable, but not depedent variable.</p>

<p>There are two basic types of variables:<br/>
Continuous Variables(e.g. height,temprature)<br/>
Discrete Variables(e.g. age, size, preferences)</p>

<p>if IV=[0,1],DV=[~] then T test<br/>
if IV=[0,1,2,],DV=[~] then one-way Anova or ANOCVA<br/>
if IV1=[0,1,2,], IV2=[0,1,2,], DV=[~] then General linear model<br/>
if IV1=[~], IV2[~],&#8230;, DV=[~], then Linear Regression &amp; Pearson<br/>
if IV=[0,1,&#8230;], DV=[0,1,&#8230;] then χ2<br/>
if IV=[~], DV=[0,1,&#8230;] then Logistic regression</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I met this problem when I was analysing teachers&#8217; PCK concept maps. I wanted to divide them into several clusters that shared the similar structures(nodes and links).</p>

<p>One approch is plotting them in a 2d picture to see if there is any patterns. But before that, you have to do the Muultidimensional Scaling to get your (x,y) from your Distance Matrix.</p>

<p>Distance Matrix<br/>

<pre><code>
# 1) MDS 'cmdscale'
dm <- read.table("distance-matrix.txt")
mds1 = cmdscale(dm, k = 2)

# plot
plot(mds1[,1], mds1[,2], type = "n", xlab = "", ylab = "", axes = FALSE, main = "cmdscale (stats)")
text(mds1[,1], mds1[,2], labels(x)[[1]], cex = 0.9, xpd = TRUE)

reserve information about what you did for the methods section<br/>
do not discuss the rationale for statistical analyses within the results section<br/>
Reserve comments on the meaning of your results for the discussion section<br/>
Just tell what the data show not what your data mean</p>

<p>Use the past tense for completed actions: we found , women were, men smoked ,was<br/>
Use the present tense for assertions that continue to be true<br/>
figure 1 show ,  finds confirm the data suggests</p>

<pre><code>* Synthesis the important not all

我只想找一口水喝
我一路疾驰
只想找一口水喝
扑灭腹中的烟火

我来到从前的小河
她已经干涸
连榕树爷爷也失去了踪影
只留下七零八落的脚踝
散落在角落里
哭干了所有的眼泪

河床里是一具尸首
早已经腐烂
散发着恶的臭
还有苍蝇的轰鸣

我又焦急的奔向湖岸
一心想喝那甘甜的湖水
湖面寂静
泛着死一样的绿
还有一片一片的鱼肚白在飘荡
没了往日的喧嚣
也没了往日伙伴们排队时的争吵

我喝了个痛快
这油亮的湖水
带着异样的满足
不为别的
我只想找一口水喝
找一口水喝
扑灭我腹中的烟火

可，可…
可这烟火却越烧越旺
连我的视线也开始燃烧起来
越痛苦、越挣扎
越挣扎、越痛苦
也不知到过了多少时间
我终于挣脱了
天空是那么的蓝
眼前是一团洁白
在风的轻抚下安睡

榕树爷爷拉着我的手
还有那村边的小河
咕咕的欢迎着我的归来
这是我的家
我再也不愿意离开
再也不愿意离开

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Writing paper for publication]]></title>
    <link href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2014/05/14/writing-paper-for-publication/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-14T10:23:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2014/05/14/writing-paper-for-publication</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Writing is an very important skill as speaking. It aims to send message, from people to people, from generation to generation, from country to country. One of the most efficient way to do this is publishing in good journals. Nowadays, publication has become a crucial part of resume or CV, and people write papers not just for sending messages but also seeking for promotions. So good universities ask faculties for good papers; good researchers look for good journals to publish. Good journals want good impactors or indexes. Good researchers tend to cite more good papers from good journals. But can this system help sending necessary message to those in-need audiences? It may not necessarily be the case. It is just a game of numbers dominated by the for-profit companies and ambitious universities who care little what the content really mean.</p>

<p>Complain is enough. We still have to write anyway. But I believe we are writing for our audiences not for universities or journal companies. We write because we have the impulse to share. As a beginning researcher, I&#8217;d like to co-write with partners at first. I can learn easier and faster by observing the writing process and talking to them about it. So I would also recommend you co-write with somebody at first.</p>

<p>Although you may not like the game, it is still good to know the rules and the tools. Here are some useful resources for writhing educational journals:</p>

<p>I found writhing is both hard and complicated. It is like a hedgehog rolls itself as a ball; you can hardly approach anyhow. First it is hard because it is hard. Especially if you don&#8217;t write often, it takes time to develop your own writing skills. Second, it is complex and complicated. Writhing a paper may include many small jobs: reading, citing, linking, analyzing, reasoning, revising, formatting, managing. It will remain hard unless you cut the job into small pieces that you can play with; Cutting tasks is a crucial managing skill.</p>

<h3>Writing tips:</h3>

<pre><code>* Write down your thoughts while you read.  
* Write it down when it come up to you.  
* Write timely before the deadline.  
* Write summary periodically.  
* Write, and then shut down disturbs.  
* Write with your ear, your mouth, and anything that helps.  
* Write briefly and clear; Every word tell.  
* Write as yourself and to be yourself.  
* Write as you are talking to a friend about your new discovery(emotion)  
</code></pre>

<h3>Writing steps:</h3>

<pre><code>1  abstract, title, journal  
2  results, logic, 5pages  
3  enrich each paragraph and link together  
4  revise and formatting  
</code></pre>

<h3>What make a paragraph good</h3>

<p>Focus on one idea<br/>
Format paragraph<br/>
  -Topic sentence<br/>
  -explanation evidence logic<br/>
-not too long: 3 sentences<br/>
-Concluding/Beginning sentence<br/>
-Paragraph work together<br/>
-unity(pronoun, sense, tongue)</p>

<h3>What make good sentence</h3>

<p>-no cluster, brief, clear, concise every word tell<br/>
-use strong verb<br/>
-make it colorful</p>

<h3>The hard thing:</h3>

<p>When you are wrting,it is hard to make the right decisions:<br/>
when to quit (something you don&#8217;t want to do now);<br/>
when to search for help (something necessary but you can&#8217;t do yourself);<br/>
when to just do the job no matter you like it or not.</p>

<h3>Writing tools:</h3>

<p><a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a> can help you co-write online.<br/>
<a href="http://www.mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a> can help you manage your references.<br/>
<a href="http://interest.science.thomsonreuters.com/forms/HistCite/">HisCite</a> can make graph to let you know how paper cited each other.<br/>
<a href="http://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/">SPSS</a> can help you analyze the data.<br/>
<a href="http://latex-project.org/intro.html">LaTeX</a> is a good document preparation system especially useful when you have lots of equations and graphs(generated with R).<br/>
There are lots of other text editors such as Miscro-soft Word, EditPlus for consider.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>星期三，5月7号，下午三点钟，我从AD楼出来，去赶公交车。这是学期的最后一天，HSC校车明天就要停开了。未来的相当一段时间里，我只有做City巴士度日了。一出门，下了台阶，太阳就火辣辣照了上来，转眼望去，一个女孩拖着一个大箱子向AD楼走来。我估量箱子很沉，她拖箱子时很费力气。望了一眼这两段陡峭的台阶，估计她要进楼很难拖得上去。她身材高挑，黑头发，黄皮肤，戴着墨镜，俨然是个亚洲人，于是我主动用英文问她是否需要帮助。她说ok，然后就把大箱子一把丢给了我，自己空着手，看着我。这也有点出乎我的意料，我本想是两个人一起把箱子抬上去，结果她要我一个人来做这个事了。唉，谁让我答应帮忙，好吧，于是我就开始费力地把这个大箱子往上面拖。拖到了中间，她问我是不是中国人，我说是？她回了一句，台湾人。第一次我没有听清楚，她又重复道，我是台湾人。我哦了一下，终于把箱子拖上去了。我看了她一眼，她没什么表示，没有用英语也没有用中文，说一声谢谢，我只好走了，她就一个人拖着箱子往门里面拽，弹簧门却故意捣乱似的卡住大箱子好几次，我本想再去帮她，但还是收住了脚步。</p>

<p>我很是好奇，她为什么不说她自己的名字，而是说台湾人。她先问我是不是中国人，我说我是中国人，但她却直接回了一句“我是台湾人”。于是，关于她我唯一了解的信息就是“她是台湾人”，一个有点骄傲的台湾人。</p>

<p>其实我的室友也是台湾人，是个男的，但是也并不像这个女孩那样。</p>

<p>我终于等到了巴士，上了车，坐到佐治亚中心换乘HSC校车。太阳还是那么毒辣，让人有个地缝都想钻进去。不巧的是等公交车的地方一棵树也没有，不过马路对面有几棵高一点的树，于是有一小块阴凉投影到我们这一边，我不自觉地钻进这小块阴凉里，为了不晒到头只好蹲下。有一个美国女孩儿，肤色略黑，也觉得太阳太难抵挡，也凑了过来。于是我们闲聊起来。我问她在等哪辆公交汽车，原来，我们等的是同一辆公交车。过去了一辆FH之后，我们的HSC就来了。上了车，我们又继续聊了一会儿，原来她是来自于美国北部的一个州，哪里的气候非常干燥，她说她花了一段时间才能适应这里湿热的气候。我说从干燥的地方到湿润的地方还是比较好适应，如果反过去就难了！我跟她讲我原来住在干燥的中国北方，但是现在工作在湿热的南方，有跟她同样的亲身体验。之后她向我介绍了她的姓名，在快要到HSC的时候她下了车，原来她不住在HSC，而是住在附近的小区里。她礼貌的跟我打了一个招呼，说很高兴见到我，我说我也是。之后她就下车了。</p>

<p>这两个女孩给我的印象极深，虽然她们的名字我已经忘了（在车上交谈时，我就说过我总忘却名字）。第一个女孩显得更时髦一些，第二个女孩儿则显得更朴实。但是，我觉得最大的不同在于她们对别人的看法以及与人交流的方式。</p>

<p>我并不是说所有的台湾人都这样，我只是一个观察点而已。但是我也至少知道了，有些台湾人多少可能会对大陆的中国人有别样的看法，甚至对帮助过她们的大陆人，也同样保留着成见。</p>

<p>有成见并不可怕，可怕的是不知道自己有成见，可怕的是不能放下成见进行平等的对话。</p>

<p>I was impressed by the Chinese American woman she played who always repeat &#8220;BUT&#8221; and &#8220;Maybe&#8221;. It heard like a typical Chinese speaker. I began to think why Chinese people tend to say these two words again and again. One reason is that they are not good at express themselves. The second reason might be they are not confident; they feel insecurity. She said that at least the food should not be poison. As you know, food, sex and sacurity are the basic needs of human according to Maslow&#8217;s hierarchy of needs.<br/>

Why Chinese people are lack of sacurity. Well, it is a long story. To make it brief&#8212;it is becuase poisonous food, polluted air and water, dominated culture and so on. A survey report that many rich people in China want to imgrant to other country such as US, Canada. Some Corrupt officials want to have orther country&#8217;s identity because they want to escape from the punishment. There also a lot of people want to go US, becuase they worry about the nature and social environment, they worry about the education and healthy of their children.</p>
