    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is an interesting class called Intro to the design of everything <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-design101/l-300162902/e-441839145/m-438038764">link here</a></p>

<p>They showed a pot that can put in water by a hole at the bottom, and no water come out. It works well.<br/>

<p>The following is one possible inner structure design in my mind.<br/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I saw this in our main library when the staff cleanup the restroom.<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/door-with-leg.png" alt="Door with leg" /><br/>
What a cool leg the door has! The idea is simple, but the result is so good. Sometimes simple change can make a big difference.</p>

<p>There also some design confuses me. Here is a table with sharp edge on the top surface. I really cannot understand what this edge serves for beyound hurting my arms when typing on my laptop.<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/table-with-sharp-edge.png" alt="Sharp edge table" /></p>

<p>Another example of confusing design. I really don't know witch controler can light a fire to the stove under my pot.
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/gas-stove.png" alt="gas stove" /></p>

<p>Nowadays, the environment is becoming worse and worse. One basic reason is bad design. Our company design good batteries with low-cost but ignored how to recycle and reuse the waste batteries. Similarly, the white pollution, air and water pollution all failded to take environment pollution cost into concern. These industries are all good examples of bad design and are badly need to change.</p>

<p>Well, how to solve these problems and create better future? The answer is design zero pollution industry pipeline. Just like the nature design all kinds of lives, no waste at all. For example, how to make use of clean energy as power for travelling. When you taking whole process into concern, you will find the horse and cart is one example of good designs. Of course, we will not return to this old method of travelling, but we really should rethink this design.</p>

<p>It is not just product design or pipeline design. It is also a life design. On behavior researcher found a very simple and effective way to save energy-- sending a letter of electric usage report comparing with neighborhood. After being told use more than twice electric than neighborhood, people tend to pay much attention to save energy. This is just how behavior science used to affect personal life styles.</p>

<p>Nowadays, people have learnt to make use clean energy such as wind, water,sun. Researchers are also trying to invent new technologies of producing and storing and converting these energy. We are going to and have to achieve no waste design in order to live a better life for long run on earth.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In agriculture age,people don't have to worry about pollution. Because all the products are degradable. Nature itself is a great designer, everything can be reused and recycled. But as human entered the age of industry, the situation changed. Human want to create new stuff that never existed in natural world. Yes they made it but they are not born good designers; Many waste are produced but can not be recycled.</p>

<p>There is a simple logic. If human want live in earth forever, then everything should be recycled, otherwise there will be not enough resources or room for human beings.</p>

<p>China have made a miracle of economic growth, but the growth cost dear -- air and water pollution, increasing gap between rich and poor, village and city, east and west. This growth also can not be sustainable because the environment is getting worse and worse and the resources is getting fewer and fewer. In order to live a healthy life, China must reconsider its style of economic growth and design more environmentally friendly industry,agriculture and living system. But do China have enough designers to design the eco-life system? It is questionalble. STEM education may play a crucial role in preparing these future designers in China.</p>

<p>If you look into Chinese secondary and primary curriculum, you will find there is little content of enginering or designing in their class learning activities. How to assess the curriculum content to tell if it is updated and suitable for preparing future citizens? How teachers address this problem in their classroom teaching? Is there a lack of designing education in our curriculum system? If not, is the content and education good enough for preparing our future designers? These questions matters for the future development of China.</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/11/19/typing-with-sound</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Nowardays people spend a lot of time in front of their computer. Most of the time they have to use their eyes whether they are typing or sufing on the internet.</p>

<p>But when you are using computer too much you will find your eyes hurt. Lots of students get short-sighted. A idea come to me, why not close my eye to type in front of a computer. Is it possible, may be ti is possible. So I try to find a sofware to help me to do this job. I find a one, and it works. Now I can sit in front of my computer and keep my eyes closed and typing wha I want to say. Isn't it amazing. This software will also help blind peaple to type, because it can sound the key so they can hear what they are typiing.</p>

<p>For me, it just helps to rest my eyes and concentrate on what I am writing.</p>

<p>This is not a new idea, but if is an intersting idea.</p>

<p>The above paragraph is written by me blindly.</p>

<p>Another idea interesting is using your left hand to control the mouse and use your right hand to click. This will help you to coordinate your left brain and right brain.</p>

<p>Now I am using the sound of pinyin to help myslef to type this paragraph. The pinyin sound help to pronounce a word when you are typing. It may not sound very right but it can do give a similar sound of the the word.</p>

<p>Is not it amazing.</p>

<p>(the following wrote by 2014/06/13)<br/>
I write of course with my eye open and without any sound. I confront the same problem again. I am wonderring what i can do with the mouse, computer interaction, becuase my fingers hurts when using mouse click too many times, I just wonder how this problem can be solved. I try to use both hands to use mouse, and now both my Forefinger hurts. Maybe I use computer too much. I admit that but there are also some problem with the design, the mouse design, or the user-computer interaction design. There are several ways to solve this problem:<br/>
1 redesign the mouse<br/>
2 redesign how computer react to the mouse<br/>
3 use keyboard instead of the mouse<br/>
4 forget the computer and use paper and pencil instead</p>

<p>The first two solutions are engineers and designers job.<br/>
The third is my job(the user habits)<br/>
The last one is not a solution for this problem but a solution for stopping the pain</p>

<p>continued on(2014/06/15)<br/>
I find out another solution already provided--but I did not discover before, using the touch pad of the computer. It is a solution,may be not perfect, because the user experience and the coceptural model is not what I want. It is also interesting that the user sometime ignore what had been provided.</p>
