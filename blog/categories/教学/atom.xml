    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>开始的时候，视频中介绍的学习环境设计，以及流动的环境给我的印象极其深刻。</p>

<p>再有，在论坛中谈到，站着进行头脑风暴的效率要比坐着的小组高。很小的设计改变就可以产生很大的影响。站立和坐着也是一种环境设计。</p>

<p>在提供了简短的视频介绍之后，主要通过明确的任务来推进学习。不仅有明确的要求、评价标准，还有可以利用的工具推荐、技术技巧介绍、过程和案例等。这给学习者很大的自主学习空间，在完成作业的过程中边做边学。</p>

<p>在组建learning squire的时候，这次我加入了别人的小组，并且进行了积极的交流。比上两次的小组要成功。小组的同伴学习虽然并没有对我的学习起到觉得性的作用，不过还是交了几个朋友。也进行了视频对话，对于语言和沟通能力是有帮助的。此外，因为没有小组作品，所以大家也没有分工合作，主要是相互分享信息和求助，这种人际环境也会让学习者具有黏性或依赖感。</p>

<p>总体来讲，单就本次课程而言，其学习环境主要包括媒体环境和人际环境，其实作业任务中也有要我们去采访和测试prototype，如果这个加上的话就有实践环境在里面了。其媒体环境的设计是非常值得学习的。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Why</h3>

<p>It is important for students to survive in such an era full of science and technology products and information.<br/>
It is also important for a country to have enough science literate talents and labors in order to survive in the global economy.<br/>
Why science important? You can go on reading another blog post<a href="http://www.letstalkscience.ca/about-us/why-science">Why science?</a></p>

<h3>We</h3>

<p>Science teacher is a career but also a job. They are playing the most important role in developing the science literacy of the next generation. We choose it and we do it.</p>

<h3>Teach</h3>

<p>Good teaching is not an accident. It is a pursely planed activity fiting students' needs and level.</p>

<h3>Science</h3>

<p>Authentic science not just includ scientific knowledge(facts, concepts, theories), but also the process of science and the nature of science.</p>

<h3>In school</h3>

<p>While school education system is still the dominant formal learning place today. So it is an crutial battle feild of science education. But science learning can happen anywhere not just in school.</p>

<h3>Why has science teaching changed over time?</h3>

<p>Science is changing everyday. New discovery, New papers, New theories and models, in fact science update itself everyday.<br/>
Student is changing every year. Students today are not like before. They have iphone, ipad, facebook. Even kids at the same age in different class response significant differently to the same question.<br/>
Society is changing too. It need more talents who are good at 4Cs: Communication, Collaboration, Critical thinking and Creativity.<br/>
Should science teaching keep the same as before? Never.</p>

<h3>How should science be taught in science classrooms?</h3>

<p>Well, It is really a hard question.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>花了整整一天的时间才把信息技术和专业英语的作业、论文以及学习总结看完。我觉得挺享受这个过程的，每一个英语小论文都是一个故事，一个实实在在奋斗和挣扎在一线岗位青年教师的故事，真心希望大家也能相互彼此阅读，看看其他同学经历的，收获的，付出的，还有抉择。另外大家的学习总结也让我对课程进行了重新的审视和反思，同学们提了很好的意见，有鼓励，也有批评，这些都是我做未来课程计划的重要依据，这点我很看重。我也会加倍努力！</p>

<p>有的时候只有从一个环境中走出来，才能更好的审视自己，不知道你们是否有同感。教师这一行要求我们必须保持开放的心态，接受你的学生，接纳新的技术，新的思想，新的策略。如果一下接受不了那么多，那么可以从一点点做起。上课的时候我们同学使用了prezi,现在我也开始使用prezi来，而且越用越好用了，这就是开放的心态，尝试的心态，遇到新东西，不是说no，而应该向老外学习说why not。我觉得作为教师，没有哪一点比这更重要了。走出来，不仅仅空间，更是思考方式和观念。愿我们都能永远具有敞开来、走出去的勇气和信念。</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes it is hard to let students collect data to test their ideas about nature. For example to make observations how stars move for a long time, or do experiment about why plant grow to the sunlight. In this case, when oboservation and experiment difficult to carry out in classroom, computer software or interactive simulations can help a lot. There are two examples.</p>

<p>In a middle school biology class, students can play with the following flash game to figure out why plant grow to the sun.</p>

<p>
In a elementary school science class, student can stuy how much water does a crow drink every day. They can also study their own diet using the same method.</p>

<p>Interactive simulations can help:<br/>
-   enage students, just give a cool show and some questions, then let them play with it.
-   stimulate students to ask questions
-   make observations and collect data or evidences<br/>
-   test their ideas</p>

<p>If teachers can guide and organize them to make explainations or argue with each other based on evidence, and make predictions and test them, at last provide opportunities for self-evaluation and community evaluations, then this approach would be more effective for learning science in classroom.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is my first time to view a science classroom teaching in Japan. In fact, it supprise me a little. I know the science education in Japan is of high quality. They get much better score than the other counties and teacher are respectable profession. But I never thought the classroom are so interactive and effective. You can click <a href="http://timssvideo.com/72">here</a> to view the video.</p>

<blockquote><p>This eighth-grade science lesson is about the formation of clouds. It is the third lesson in a sequence of 19 lessons on weather. The lesson is 53 minutes in duration. There are 25 students in the class.<br/>
<video width='720' height='480' preload='none' controls poster=' https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/timssvideo.png'><source src='http://timssvid1.s3.amazonaws.com/JP5%20Air%20compression%20and%20expansion.mp4' type='video/mp4; codecs="avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2"'/></video></p></blockquote>

<p>Here is my record of the time usage of the class:</p>

<blockquote><p>00-03 review what learnt<br/>
03-07 demistration<br/>
07-17 demistration of key skills for today's experiment<br/>
18-36 Student activites(4 experiments and group take turn)<br/>
36-50 sumary of experiment result and draw conclusion<br/>
50-52 self-evalation</p></blockquote>

<p>I watched the video twice, first I just got a glance of it very quickly. The second time, I watch it very carefully and make notes of what teacher and students were doing.</p>

<p>First, I found a very interesting thing that the Japenese teacher used about 17 minutes to engage students and make demonstration at the begining. He also used about 17 minutes to sumary the results and conclusions at the end of the class. Acording to psychology studies, people are most likely to remember what happened at begining and at the end. People usually can only concentrate for 15 minutes. So most TED videos will not last more than 17 minutes. I don't know if the teacher did it popurely. But he did it really well.</p>

<p>Second, the class is very interesting and vigorous. Students really had fun with the activities and record and try to explain.</p>

<p>Third, it keep a good balance of knowledge-centered and student-centered. The most important ideas and inquiry skills were embodied in student activities.</p>

<p>At last, I want to say although the teacher said nothing about modeling. But he raised a question for students to study.  Students want to explain but had little idea and experieces. So they did the activities that teacher prepared for them. Before experiments, they make their explannation and predictions, they recorded the result on the handouts, they have to revise their explanation and building a more powerful causal model to explain all the phenomenons. So we do can found the shape of modeling in this class.</p>
