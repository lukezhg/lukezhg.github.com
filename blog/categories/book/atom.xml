    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Recently I was reading a book <a href="http://books.google.com/books/about/Clinical_Supervision_and_Teacher_Develop.html?id=O3ycAAAAMAAJ">Clinical Supervision and Teacher Development</a></p>

<p>Notes taken from another book chapter-Glickman -chapter 4.pdf<br/>
Research on effective instruction() indicates that effective instruction is based on adaption of curriculum and materials to local settings and particular learning goals. In other words, effective teachers think about what they are currently doing, assess the results of their practice, explore with each other new possibilities  for teaching students, and are able to consider students' perspectives.<br/>

    <link href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/08/25/surpassing-shanghai/"/>
    <updated>2013-08-25T21:08:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/08/25/surpassing-shanghai</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>最近在QQ论坛里，有同学提到这本书《超越上海：美国应该如何建设世界顶尖的教育系统》。这个标题容易给人一种误解，以为中国的教育已经在美国前头了，这绝对是错误的理解。<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/Surpassing-Shanghai.jpg" alt="Surpassing Shanghai" /><br/>
其实美国人的危机意识很强烈，从《A nation at risk》到《No child left behind》都显示了国家对教育的重视，特别是科学教育，其实大家去查一查各国的教育财政预算比例就清楚了。之所以很多美国学者喊狼来了，道理很简单，第一是危机意识，第二，为了获得更多关注、科研项目和财政支持。这种危机意识是这个国家保持全球第一的重要条件。</p>

<p>其实简单的说美国教育好或者中国教育好是没有意义的，另外上海的pisa成绩根本代表不了中国，大家闭着眼睛想一想自己家乡的教育状况就心中有数了。</p>

<p>另外再看看我们学生高考完的表现，焚书啊！你说教育取得了多少成绩，我说很惨，没有发自内心的热爱，一票否决。</p>

<p>最近看了Timss的几个课堂视频，强列推荐大家看看，特别是日本的中学科学课堂。大家可以自己比一比，想一想。<a href="http://timssvideo.com/72">Timssvideo-Japan-Physics</a></p>

<p>千万不要被上海的pisa成绩或者这本书的标题蒙骗了，要想想样本的代表性以及作者的立场。说到科学教育，中国科学教育者还有很长的一段路要走。</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2011/11/27/brain-bugs</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>在笑来的博客上看到，这本书《Brain bugs》，笑说有趣的很。于是打开看了一下目录还有网站的Demos如下：<br />Brain Bugs | Demos<br />: http://www.brainbugs.org/demos.html<br /><br />上面的页面上列举了很多brain bugs。<br />比如McGurk Effect，上面有一个女人在发言，但是当你闭上眼睛的时候，你听到的是一个声音，当你睁开眼睛的时候你听到的是另外一个声音。（我猜测是收到了发音者口型的影响）<br /><br />再比如Baker-baker Paradox<br />我们经常会忘记某个人的名字，但是多半会记得他的职业。即使是一个叫Baker的baker，我们还是容易自己的他是一个面包师。原因在于，我们记忆一个人的职业的时候，会有很多相关的概念协同起来，而名字则很少协同记忆。（也许老师们也可以尝试为学生的名字富于内涵，从而便于记忆）<br />这也提示我们，在教学过程中，应该把新概念与学生的已有概念产生更多的来联系，使其协同起来，而不是像名字一样孤零零的，最后被遗忘。<br /><br />再如Flash Lag Effect<br />我在预测红球的时候，总是预测超前50左右，这就是为什么足球边裁判罚越位中有24%为误判的原因。其原因是我们的视觉系统在关注其他信号的同时，总是倾向于超前估计运动物体的位置。<br /><br />再如Leaning Tower Illusion<br />看起来右侧的塔会更加的倾斜，但是其实两个塔的照片是完全相同。<br /><br />这是采访本书作者的录音：http://pd.npr.org/anon.npr-mp3/npr/fa/2011/07/20110714_fa_01.mp3<br /></p>
