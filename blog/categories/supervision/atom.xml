    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I attended a workshop about co-teaching and mentoring by Dr Dresden. Georgia is going to promote co-teaching in the future. This was a foundational workshop for mentor teachers, in which they could know about what is co-teaching, how it is different from traditional mentoring, what kinds of approaches can be used. This was the task of the morning session. In the afternoon mentoring session, teachers were divided into 3 groups to work out how to welcome your teacher candidates, stages of their concern, and scenarios playing and discussions.</p>

<p>I found it interesting to hear what the mentor teacher say. Although co-teaching sounds like a powerful idea to make the internships session more effective, there are still lots of barriers and problems to overcome and handle with. Mentors do need to know how to co-teach, why to co-teach, what to do, but this is not enough. Another important part is the collaboration and communication between each pieces. Well teacher candidates, university professors are in university system, while teacher mentors are in the middle school system, they have different responsibilities and roles, they have few chances to work together, they are all very busy and tend to draw back for lack of time or inconvinient reasons. You know what, it takes time and energy and wisdom to build trust relationships between them.</p>

<p>So in the afternoon session, communication skills are stressed. But I think it would be more helpful if supervisors and teacher candidates can show up and speak their voices. Well may be this will be done during the Pairs workshop.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>How to make supervision sustainable?</h3>

<p>==>Design and Develop a mutual benefit and win-win relationship between participants.<br/>
It is kind of like to do a jigsaw. First you have to see every piece very clearly and then you can make the best guess and try to connect the two pieces.</p>

<h3>Look into the pieces(participants):</h3>

<p>Supervisor<br/>
- typically are university professors(University)<br/>
- experienced in-service teachers(Middle School)<br/>
- principles(Middle School)</p>

<p>Supervisee<br/>
- new teacher(Middle School)<br/>
- student teacher(University)<br/>
- in-service teacher who want to make a change(Middle School)</p>

<p>Facilitators<br/>
- companies<br/>
- administrators(MS)
- Professors<br/>
- stuff(MS, U)
- reformers<br/>
- NGO<br/>
- Government</p>

<h3>Possible Groups(supervisor,supervisee,facilitators):</h3>

<p>Single Community:<br/>
(student teacher, student teacher, professor)<br/>
(in-service teacher, in-service teacher, adminstrator)
(Experienced teacher, new teacher, stuff)</p>

<p>Cross two communities:<br/>
(Professor,(in-service teacher, student teacher),stuff)<br/>
(Professor,in-service teacher, administrators)<br/>
(Professor,(in-service teacher &amp; student teacher),stuff)<br/>
(In-service teacher, student teacher, professor)<br/>
((Professor &amp; in-service teacher),(in-service teacher &amp; student teacher),Professor)</p>

<p>Cross three communities:<br/>
(Professor,(in-service teacher &amp; student teacher), company)<br/>
(Professor,(in-service teacher &amp; student teacher),NGO)<br/>
(Professor,in-service teacher, Government)<br/>
(Professor,in-service teacher, reformers)</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/17/the-ways-that-content-knowledge-matters</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Question:<br/>
What an expert teacher who has deep content knowledge can do?</p>

<p>Notes in class Supervision:<br/>
-give more proper instances, analogys to make student understand clearly<br/>
-relate the knowledge with students lives<br/>
-pick out the important big ideas that organizing the knowledge feild<br/>
-be able to emphasize crosscutting concepts
-be competent in science practices<br/>
-design more logical sequence of the content knowledge<br/>
-be able to understand students' difficulties and questions and has a clue</p>

<p>Additional ways(after class):<br/>
-ask good questions<br/>
-design sound learning activities and assignments<br/>
-have insights of students question or problems<br/>
-organize facts and concepts in a sense making way or framework<br/>
-have more backup examples,analogys, explainations, questions for use<br/>
-be confident to give students more opotions and more challeging jobs</p>

<p>In a word, content knowledge affect teachers' abilities of transfroming the curriculum and materials to students in a special context to acheive a designed learning goal. It is the foundation of science teacher knowledge. If there is no good content knowledge, there is no good content to transform.</p>

<p>It is like the nutrition in the food, if the food contain no nutriton, the best cook can do nothing to help.</p>

<p>It is also like taxi driver. The driver who knows the traffic system well, is possiblely able to figure out the most quick way to go for you at a special time and location. Content knowledge just provide more pathes to consider and follow. Otherwise, it is easy to get lost and embarrassed.</p>
