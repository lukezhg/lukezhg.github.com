<p>The materials our group used:<br/>
  1. 5 bottles of coco (4 diet coco, 1 coco)<br/>
  1. 25 memos(5 fruit memos and 20 memos)<br/>
  1. 5 ml salt<br/>
  1. 1 measurer ruler<br/>
  1. 1 funnel</p>

<p>The 5 cocos were used as 5 experiment as control, coco, fruit memos, flat, salt. We measured the height of the coco before and after experiment, so we could count how much coco get out of the bottle. Here is what we got.<br/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today Dr. Oliver gave us an amazing class about demonstration and inquiry. He first asked what question to think about or ask ourselves when using demonstration. Then we played two demonstration games with everybody totally engaged.</p>

<p>The first is radiometer (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crookes_radiometer">Crookes radiometer - Wikipedia</a>).<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/radiometer.jpg" alt="Crookes Radiometer" /></p>

<p>He just put it on a table and lighted up another bulb, it began to rotate. It was my first time to see this, I was very curious of its work principle. After close observation, I found that it rotated always the same direction with white vane in front and black vane behind.</p>

<p>Then we began to wonder what factors caused the vanes to rotate. Lights? But how? Temperature? how? What else? How can we found out? Try it. I tried using different angles of the light.</p>

<p>We also tried to use hot water and cold water to pure on it. It rotate exactly the same direction as using light when using hot water but the opposite direction when using cold water.<br/>
Nobody came up with a good explantion at the end. First I thought it was because the momentum of the absorbed Photon just like Crookes did which was wrong in this situation.</p>

<p>Then we began to do another game --Buoyancy.<br/>
First Dr. Oliver sent out a pre-test with 3 yes no questions about buoyancy followed why you believe so. Then we talked about each question a little while. Students answers and opinions are totally different.<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/pre-test.png" alt="Pre-test" /><br/>
Let us found out. So he did another demonstration droppiing a brass cube into water cup which had been balanced. He asked us what would happen if he immersed it into the water.<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/drop-into-water.png" alt="Brass cube into water" /><br/>
We made our predictions and then we did the experiment. We also tried some other settings which were carefully designed but playfully demonstrated.How do you use these demonstration in large class size like 30 students?</p>

<p>At the end of the class, he use his front pocket quesitons to reflect this lesson:<br/>
Does it elict students' ideas for teaching?<br/>
Does it it help student make sense of the material activity?<br/>
Dose it press students for evidenced based reasoning and communicating?</p>

<p>Yes it does! Yeah, we succeed!</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2014/06/16/modify-my-previous-lesson-esci7040-a1</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is an assignment of Dr. Oliver's class ESCI7040(teaching strategies). The goal of this activity is to reflect on my own teaching and modify the plans for future teaching.</p>

<p>I taught learning theories to undergraduates in order to let them make sense of how students learn and apply these principles in their future teaching.</p>

<p>The guiding question is what is knowledge and how people learn? The big ideas include:<br/>
1. Different type of knowledge play different roles and people learn them differently.<br/>
2. Learning Science is not just learning scientific knowledge but also science practice and the nature of science.<br/>
3. Teacher need various types of knowledge to help students learn science.<br/>
4. Different learning theories understand people's learning differently and give different suggestions for teaching and learning.<br/>
5. Preconceptions, learning styles, learning strategies play an important role in students' learning.</p>

<p>This lesson takes 90 minutes and during 60 minutes I was lecturing.</p>

<h3>Task1: Reflections of this lesson:</h3>

<ol>
<li>Wether the content of this lesson can effectively help them understand how students learn science and apply these principles in their teaching?<br/>
Some ideas are too general and loosely related. They should be deleted or modified.<br/>
You should focus more on students' learning not teachers' learning<br/>
Don't try to cover every learning theories, teach the most important one and the crucial strategies or tools.<br/>
You may also included some brain-based learning studies such as how learning occur and what factors may affect learning.<br/>
Conceptual change should be included in this lesson.</li>
<li><p>Are these goals/objectives appropriate for your students?<br/>
These goals are not challenging enough for undergraduates. More critical thinking and challenging tasks should be used in this lesson.<br/>
You can try to related your teaching methods with learning principles and invite students to think both in the role of learners and teacher(your role).</p></li>
<li><p>How were the goals/objectives appropriate for the course in which the unit was taught?<br/>
I found that I simply followed the sequence of the textbook. I may first teach this lesson 'learning theory' (Chapter 4) and then teach 'teaching strategies'(Chapter 3). Students should first know how leaning happen and then learn how to teach.</p></li>
<li><p>How the instructional strategies adequate for the learning you hoped would happen?<br/>
Lecture should be more interactive(share learning experience of yours or students, thinking aloud, student teaching), include more student-centered activities (sorting learning tasks, diagnosing students' learning difficulties, think-pair-share, one minute writing, interpret teaching clips).</p></li>
<li><p>How were the assessments--either formal or informal--adequate(and valid and reliable) for the task of assessing student learning?<br/>
There are two assessments: A1 explain Osmosis to high school students; A2 design a 5E lesson plan. A1 is an informal assessment on class. A2 seems not closely related with this lesson. A better assignment would be study students' preconceptions about one topic and design an activity to elicit students prior ideas.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Task 2 redesign:</h3>

<h4>The big ideas that student should understand:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Learners build their knowledge on their prior knowledge collaboratively in special social context or situations.</li>
<li>Learning occur when connections are made in Neural Networks or social networks.</li>
<li>Well designed physical and social learning environment help students learn by improving their brains' function.</li>
<li>Prior ideas, emotion, metacogniton play crucial roles in students' science learning.</li>
<li>Different learning strategies suit for different learning tasks; Some tasks are more difficult than others; Student percept learning tasks differently.</li>
</ol>


<h4>The skills that student should develop:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Elicit and engage students' prior ideas of a core concept.</li>
<li>Diagnosis students' difficulties in learning a concept.</li>
<li>Design or redesign classroom learning environment to optimize students' learning.</li>
<li>Select proper learning strategies for special learning tasks.</li>
<li>Summary learning research results and its implications for teaching.</li>
</ol>


<h4>The interactive lecture and student activities:</h4>

<p>Tell the story of two kids arguing about sun:</p>

<pre><code>孔子到东方游历，遇见两个小孩在路上争辩，便问原因。一个小孩说：“太阳刚升起时距离人近。”另一个小孩说：“太阳中午的时候才距离人近呢。” 一个小孩又说：“不对，太阳刚升起的时候大得像个车盖，到了正午就小得像一个盘子，这不是远处的看着小而近处的看着大的道理吗？” 另一个小孩说：“太阳刚升起的时候清凉，到了中午的时候像手伸进热水里一样热，这不是近的时候感觉热而远的时候感觉凉的道理吗？”  
</code></pre>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/two-kids-argue-sun.png" alt="tow kids argue sun" /><br/>
Which kid do you agree with?<br/>
How about the situation of winter and summer?<br/>
If you are going to teaching these two kids the model of sun and earth, what are you going to do with these ideas? <br/>
Pretest: What do you know about learning? Yes or No question and why?<br/>
Learning occur easily and fast. Yes No<br/>
Learning is mainly remembering and recalling. Yes NO<br/>
Learning is a process that seldom change. Yes No<br/>
Learning ability can be enhanced though learning effort. Yes No<br/>
How this lesson Connect, extend or challenge what you know and how you teach?</p>

<p>Can you share a impressive learning experience that happened to you before? Or your most powerful learning strategy?</p>

<h4>Different types of learning:</h4>

<p>Learning subject: Machine learning, human learning, animal learning<br/>
Learning method: Discovery learning, guided discovery, inquiry-based learning, Problem-based learning; learning from instruction, rote learning, learning from examples, learning by analogy, explanation-based learning<br/>
Learning object: Conceptural learning(facts, concepts, model, theory), skill learning(process, strategies), emotion, attitude and value learning, metacognitive learning<br/>
Learning result: Deep learning, surface learning, meaningful learning,rote learning,effective or ineffective learning<br/>
Learning effort or emotion: hard learning, lazy learning, happy learning,painful learning<br/>
Learning sensory and style: eye, ear, feel, action, think, taste, smell</p>

<p>What can you learn from the following objective verb table?<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/objective-verb-table.png" alt="objective verbs table" /></p>

<ol>
<li><p>Think-pair-share<br/>
Read a research paper of misconception, write down all possible ways to elicit students' prior ideas, share with peers how these prior ideas are going to affect students' learning.</p></li>
<li><p>Ask a student to thinking aloud about a Buoyancy problem; Ask another student to think aloud about a phototropism problem; Ask the third student to think aloud about a NO2 chemical equilibrium problem. Interview them a little bit.</p></li>
<li><p>Share personal learning strategy (Chemical equilibrium).<br/>

List as many different types of learning tasks as you can in your group?<br/>
Group them as many ways as you can?</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Sorting learning tasks:<br/>
Write down the definition of enzyme.<br/>
Judge whether x is Enzyme or not.<br/>
Compare Plant and animal cell structures.<br/>
Draw the process of Mitosis.<br/>
Design the law of using human embryonic cells as research materials.<br/>
Count the Probability of a special Phenotype in the next generation.<br/>
Explain why egg shells are not too thin or too thick.</p>

<p>Learning strategies:<br/>
compare and group, summarize, visualize, hands-on, simplize, break down</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Student teaching one concept to other students or one screen to the class.<br/>
They need to be the volunteer and download the material and learn it before class, they have 3 minutes to help group members to understand this concept. Students will share their learning experience and give feedback to the volunteer teacher.</p></li>
<li><p>Diagnosing students' learning difficulties in a teaching clip.<br/>
Teacher will show a clip of real teaching, the students are asked to make sense what is happening and what to do with the situation.</p></li>
<li><p>Write one minute about what you learn or change today about learning, what is your most favorite analogy of learning now, share with your partner.</p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Task 3 reflect on why you change:</h3>

<p>My previous purpose is follow and cover the most important content both on the textbook and in my vision. I spent a lot of time on how to represent these content to students but did not pay too much attention to how these content serve the goal of this course. At that time, I did not have many activities to choose from and had to create my own one by one. I also had limited knowledge of how students learn science before, now I know more. So I want to include the more important ideas that I know and get rid of un important or unrelated ideas.</p>

<p>Although I believed that I should use more student-centered activities, but I just didn't have them. It took time for me to gather, test, accumulate related activities or ideas. My enriched learning experiences and pedagogical thinking also help me to generate new activities that probably work for my students.</p>

<p>Recently, I read some papers and books about evidence-based teaching and brain-based learning, they also encourage me to select the core ideas and activities for my teaching plan.</p>

<p>Conclusion: If you want to improve your teaching practice, you need to know more about the content, more about your students, more about what you can possibly do and use in your class. Of course, you also have to know what student really learn and why they do so.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Oliver let us read this following paper and write one or two paragraph of summary.<br/>
Nuthall, G. (2004). Relating Classroom Teaching to Student Learning: A Critical Analysis of Why Research Has Failed to Bridge the Theory-Practice Gap. Harvard Educational Review, 74(3), 273–307.</p>

<p>It is good paper to read, although it is a little long for non-native English speaker.</p>

<p>Here is what I got:</p>

<p>It matters how teacher look at and use educational research.<br/>
Is this why western culture emphase qualitative studies than quantitative studies?<br/>
The precondition of this approach is that teacher education help teachers do so. So it should be one topic in teacher education program.<br/>
why research necessary for teacher development<br/>
what research questions are more hard to know by only practicing<br/>
What relationship existes between teaching and learning</p>

<p>Why educational research is necessary:<br/>
1 teacher hard to see learning evidence (only some students)<br/>
2 reseach can help identify teachers' tacit beliefs and limitations<br/>
3 learning in students' mind are not easy to see by teachers where research should help.</p>

<p>learning is an inner process that can not easily seen<br/>
Research should help teacher see this process</p>

<p>Teachers need an explanatory theory of the teaching-learning relationship that meets these
requirements in order to plan, carry out, and evaluate their daily activities effectively and efficiently(Floden, 2001; Levin &amp; ODonnell, 1999).</p>

<p>Teachers usually take teaching-learning consequence for granted and when it don't, it is student to blame.</p>

<p>Classroom 3 layers:<br/>
visible activities and behaviors<br/>
semi-visible stu-stu<br/>
semivisible individual stu</p>

<p>what role student-private-talk play in student learning(online learning sometimes is the case when learners do not interact with peers.)</p>

<p>understanding how teaching is related to learning requires an understanding of:<br/>
1. teacher influence<br/>
2. sociocultural influence<br/>
3. student make sense of their classroom experience</p>

<p>a theory of effective teaching is still needed in order to know when to look and what to look for when you observe the teachers classroom activities.</p>

<p>Best of these studies had two enormous advantages over previous research:<br/>
First, they were based on systematic observation or audio- and video-recording of teacher and student behavior. Second, independent measures of student learning that were directly related to the student experi- ences being observed were used in almost all of the best studies.</p>

<p>Teachers themselves are not always good at rating student achievement, as their ratings tend to be strongly affected by student behavior and motivation, crediting the most attentive and interested with higher achievement (Gold- enberg, Gallimore, Reese, &amp; Garnier, 2001)</p>

<p>The problem of process-product studies or careless quantitative studies is neglecting the context and other students out of</p>

<p>The study, however, is of little use in advancing our knowledge about the teaching-learning relationship</p>

<p>I have already made the point that teachers cannot be aware of critical elements in the
teaching-learning process in their own classrooms unless they already have a clear understanding of what to look for and have additional ways of observing or recording the experiences of individual students.</p>

<p>If you simply looked at the post-test totals, you would incorrectly assume that the more able students learned more than the less able students.</p>

<p>But it cannot produce generalizable knowledge (or an evi- dence based explanatory theory) of the relationships between the alternative versions of the visible structure and the basis model (to use Oser and Baeriswyls model) that can be transferred from classroom to classroom.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that how students learn and how their learning is shaped by the actions of the teacher is always unique and context dependent (Barab &amp; Kirschner, 2001; Bolster, 1983). This claim is both true and not true.</p>

<p>Part of the professional knowledge of teachers must be the distinction between what is unique to a specific context and what is generalizable across all students and/or contexts. While the latter is the proper focus of research on the teaching-learning relationship, an adequate explanatory theory should help us to distinguish between the two.</p>

<p>individual case studies of teaching, provided they include data about student experience and learning that can be directly connected to observations of specific classroom activities, can provide invaluable insights into the processes that lie behind the teaching-learning relationship.(baby project)</p>

<p>I believe that the professional knowledge base that is most needed to improve the quality of teaching and teacher education is knowledge about the ways in which classroom activities, including teaching, affect the changes taking place in the minds of students: what students know and believe and what they can do with their knowledge (what I have called above practical explanatory theory). At the heart of the problem that teachers face in the classroom is knowing what is going on in the minds of the students (Steffe, Thompson, &amp; von Glasersfeld, 2000).</p>

<p>Suggestions for future studies:<br/>
1. Independent in-depth assessment of what students learn.<br/>
2. Complete, continuous data on individual student experience.<br/>
3. Complete, continuous data on classroom activities.<br/>
4. Analysis based on the continuous connections among classroom activities, student experiences, and learning processes.<br/>
5. Avoid the aggregation of data.<br/>
6. Explanatory theory must be directly and transparently connected to relevant evidence.</p>

    <link href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/27/reflection-on-groupwork-modeling/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-27T11:00:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/27/reflection-on-groupwork-modeling</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have wrote several posts about modeling:<br/>
Such as <a href="/blog/2013/08/24/interaction-simulation-based-inquiry-activities/">Interactive simulation based inquiry activities</a><br/>
Look for more click <a href="/tag/modeling/">here</a></p>

<p>But this time I would rather to think modeling from the groupwork perspective.</p>

<p>As a teacher, we should keep in mind that groupwork can only be flowers while big science ideas are the real fruits. The big flowers don't guaranteed the fruits are big.</p>

<p>Groupwork tasks take times, so they must be well designed and organized.</p>

<p>What do I mean by well designed? The groupwork should meet the following preconditions:<br/>
1.  It is highly realated with the science idea that student are going to learn.<br/>
2.  It is challenging enough that it can't be done individually.<br/>
3.  It is reachable for students with their present knowledges and skills.<br/>
4.  It generates meaningful discussions and productive outcommings.</p>

<p>What do I mean by well organized? The teacher should do the following:<br/>
1.  Students' prior idea should be explored and addressed.<br/>
2.  Possiblely related science theories or ideas should be put on the table(eg by brainstorming).<br/>
3.  All group members should engaged actively and equally in the task.<br/>
4.  Students can learn to communicate and collaborate like scientists.<br/>
5.  Competition can be used to save time and for fun.</p>

<p>How to help students to generate more productive group conversation?<br/>
1.  State proper questions or the tasks clearly. Everyone knows what to do.<br/>
2.  Use deep silent thinking and wide brainstorm, Enage what students prior ideas and concepts to expain the data/phenomenon? Everyone needs to participate in group conversation in some way.<br/>
3.  Visualize group ideas or models with tools and posters.<br/>
4.  Test and Review the models critically and make suggestions.<br/>
5.  Revise the models in light of new data and feedbacks from class community.</p>
