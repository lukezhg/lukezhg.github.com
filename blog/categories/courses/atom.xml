    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Oliver let us read this following paper and write one or two paragraph of summary.<br/>
Nuthall, G. (2004). Relating Classroom Teaching to Student Learning: A Critical Analysis of Why Research Has Failed to Bridge the Theory-Practice Gap. Harvard Educational Review, 74(3), 273–307.</p>

<p>It is good paper to read, although it is a little long for non-native English speaker.</p>

<p>Here is what I got:</p>

<p>It matters how teacher look at and use educational research.<br/>
Is this why western culture emphase qualitative studies than quantitative studies?<br/>
The precondition of this approach is that teacher education help teachers do so. So it should be one topic in teacher education program.<br/>
why research necessary for teacher development<br/>
what research questions are more hard to know by only practicing<br/>
What relationship existes between teaching and learning</p>

<p>Why educational research is necessary:<br/>
1 teacher hard to see learning evidence (only some students)<br/>
2 reseach can help identify teachers' tacit beliefs and limitations<br/>
3 learning in students' mind are not easy to see by teachers where research should help.</p>

<p>learning is an inner process that can not easily seen<br/>
Research should help teacher see this process</p>

<p>Teachers need an explanatory theory of the teaching-learning relationship that meets these
requirements in order to plan, carry out, and evaluate their daily activi- ties effectively and efficiently(Floden, 2001; Levin &amp; ODonnell, 1999).</p>

<p>Teachers usually take teaching-learning consequence for granted and when it don't it is student to blame.</p>

<p>Classroom 3 layers:<br/>
visible activities and behaviors<br/>
semi-visible stu-stu<br/>
semivisible individual stu</p>

<p>what role student-private-talk play in student learning(online learning sometimes is the case when learners do not interact with peers.)</p>

<p>understanding how teaching is related to learning requires an understanding of:<br/>
1. teacher influence<br/>
2. sociocultural influence<br/>
3. student make sense of their classroom experience</p>

<p>a theory of effective teaching is still needed in order to know when to look and what to look for when you observe the teachers classroom activities.</p>

<p>Best of these studies had two enormous advantages over previous research:<br/>
First, they were based on systematic observation or audio- and video-recording of teacher and student behavior. Second, independent measures of student learning that were directly related to the student experi- ences being observed were used in almost all of the best studies.</p>

<p>Teachers themselves are not always good at rating student achievement, as their ratings tend to be strongly affected by student behavior and motivation, crediting the most attentive and interested with higher achievement (Gold- enberg, Gallimore, Reese, &amp; Garnier, 2001)</p>

<p>The problem of process-product studies or careless quantitative studies is neglecting the context and other students out of</p>

<p>The study, however, is of little use in advancing our knowledge about the teaching-learning relationship</p>

<p>I have already made the point that teachers cannot be aware of critical elements in the
teaching-learning process in their own classrooms unless they already have a clear understanding of what to look for and have additional ways of observing or recording the experiences of individual students.</p>

<p>If you simply looked at the post-test totals, you would incorrectly assume that the more able learned more than the less able.</p>

<p>But it cannot produce generalizable knowledge (or an evi- dence based explanatory theory) of the relationships between the alternative versions of the visible structure and the basis model (to use Oser and Baeriswyls model) that can be transferred from classroom to classroom.</p>

<p>It has been claimed that how students learn and how their learning is shaped by the actions of the teacher is always unique and context dependent (Barab &amp; Kirschner, 2001; Bolster, 1983). This claim is both true and not true.</p>

<p>Part of the professional knowledge of teachers must be the distinction between what is unique to a specific context and what is generalizable across all students and/or contexts. While the latter is the proper focus of research on the teaching-learning relationship, an adequate explanatory theory should help us to distinguish between the two.</p>

<p>individual case studies of teaching, provided they include data about student experience and learning that can be directly connected to observations of specific classroom activities, can provide invaluable insights into the processes that lie behind the teaching-learning relationship.(baby project)</p>

<p>I believe that the professional knowledge base that is most needed to improve the quality of teaching and teacher education is knowledge about the ways in which classroom activities, including teaching, affect the changes taking place in the minds of students: what students know and believe and what they can do with their knowledge (what I have called above practical explanatory theory). At the heart of the problem that teachers face in the classroom is knowing what is going on in the minds of the students (Steffe, Thompson, &amp; von Glasersfeld, 2000).</p>

<p>Suggestions for future studies:<br/>
1. Independent in-depth assessment of what students learn.<br/>
2. Complete, continuous data on individual student experience.<br/>
3. Complete, continuous data on classroom activities.<br/>
4. Analysis based on the continuous connections among classroom activities, student experiences, and learning processes.<br/>
5. Avoid the aggregation of data.<br/>
6. Explanatory theory must be directly and transparently connected to relevant evidence.</p>

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[reflection on groupwork modeling]]></title>
    <link href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/27/reflection-on-groupwork-modeling/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-27T11:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/27/reflection-on-groupwork-modeling</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have wrote several posts about modeling:<br/>
Such as <a href="/blog/2013/08/24/interaction-simulation-based-inquiry-activities/">Interactive simulation based inquiry activities</a><br/>
Look for more click <a href="/tag/modeling/">here</a></p>

<p>But this time I would rather to think modeling from the groupwork perspective.</p>

<p>As a teacher, we should keep in mind that groupwork can only be flowers while big science ideas are the real fruits. The big flowers don't guaranteed the fruits are big.</p>

<p>Groupwork tasks take times, so they must be well designed and organized.</p>

<p>What do I mean by well designed? The groupwork should meet the following preconditions:<br/>
1.  It is highly realated with the science idea that student are going to learn.<br/>
2.  It is challenging enough that it can't be done individually.<br/>
3.  It is reachable for students with their present knowledges and skills.<br/>
4.  It generates meaningful discussions and productive outcommings.</p>

<p>What do I mean by well organized? The teacher should do the following:<br/>
1.  Students' prior idea should be explored and addressed.<br/>
2.  Possiblely related science theories or ideas should be put on the table(eg by brainstorming).<br/>
3.  All group members should engaged actively and equally in the task.<br/>
4.  Students can learn to communicate and collaborate like scientists.<br/>
5.  Competition can be used to save time and for fun.</p>

<p>How to help students to generate more productive group conversation?<br/>
1.  State proper questions or the tasks clearly. Everyone knows what to do.<br/>
2.  Use deep silent thinking and wide brainstorm, Enage what students prior ideas and concepts to expain the data/phenomenon? Everyone needs to participate in group conversation in some way.<br/>
3.  Visualize group ideas or models with tools and posters.<br/>
4.  Test and Review the models critically and make suggestions.<br/>
5.  Revise the models in light of new data and feedbacks from class community.</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2009/07/06/prepare-to-develop-a-curriculum-for-biology-teachers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven't thought out the name of the curriculum. But I do believe that begining teachers need a curriculum which specially designed for them.  The goal of this curriculum, may be not one but many, is to promote teachers' professional development. They can learn how to design a lesson, how to use science inquiry as a teaching strategy, how to reflect on thier teaching practices, how to write a article to publish, how to find or found a community for suport. I want make this kind of curriculum open to any one who want to learn. If the learners can pass some examination then they can be learning leaders in our community(<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/bioteahouse" target="_blank">BioTeaHouse</a>).</p>




<p>Well, before action, It is just an idea which is not new. So the point is to try and make it ture!</p>

    <link href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2009/06/07/critical-thinking-and-constructional-suggestions/"/>
    <updated>2009-06-07T00:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2009/06/07/critical-thinking-and-constructional-suggestions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we have many many info sources and much much information to check out. But it is still difficult for us to access the right info precisely and quickly. There are too much unrelated info to let out, and too much incorrect info to correct. And we should also learn to judge which info source is more comprehensive and which is just one-sided or even telling lies.</p>




<p>But before we learning  critical thinking, we should be able to have accesss to all the info sources. We need this kind of freedom to access more info sources, then we can have a more comprehensive view.  Having the ability of critical thinking is not  for just criticizing,  but to give constructional suggestions which help to make a change and let the thing on the right direction.</p>
