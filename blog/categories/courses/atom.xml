    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have wrote several posts about modeling:<br/>
Such as <a href="/blog/2013/08/24/interaction-simulation-based-inquiry-activities/">Interactive simulation based inquiry activities</a><br/>
Look for more click <a href="/tag/modeling/">here</a></p>

<p>But this time I would rather to think modeling from the groupwork perspective.</p>

<p>As a teacher, we should keep in mind that groupwork can only be flowers while big science ideas are the real fruits. The big flowers don't guaranteed the fruits are big.</p>

<p>Groupwork tasks take times, so they must be well designed and organized.</p>

<p>What do I mean by well designed? The groupwork should meet the following preconditions:<br/>
1.  It is highly realated with the science idea that student are going to learn.<br/>
2.  It is challenging enough that it can't be done individually.<br/>
3.  It is reachable for students with their present knowledges and skills.<br/>
4.  It generates meaningful discussions and productive outcommings.</p>

<p>What do I mean by well organized? The teacher should do the following:<br/>
1.  Students' prior idea should be explored and addressed.<br/>
2.  Possiblely related science theories or ideas should be put on the table(eg by brainstorming).<br/>
3.  All group members should engaged actively and equally in the task.<br/>
4.  Students can learn to communicate and collaborate like scientists.<br/>
5.  Competition can be used to save time and for fun.</p>

<p>How to help students to generate more productive group conversation?<br/>
1.  State proper questions or the tasks clearly. Everyone knows what to do.<br/>
2.  Use deep silent thinking and wide brainstorm, Enage what students prior ideas and concepts to expain the data/phenomenon? Everyone needs to participate in group conversation in some way.<br/>
3.  Visualize group ideas or models with tools and posters.<br/>
4.  Test and Review the models critically and make suggestions.<br/>
5.  Revise the models in light of new data and feedbacks from class community.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven't thought out the name of the curriculum. But I do believe that begining teachers need a curriculum which specially designed for them.  The goal of this curriculum, may be not one but many, is to promote teachers' professional development. They can learn how to design a lesson, how to use science inquiry as a teaching strategy, how to reflect on thier teaching practices, how to write a article to publish, how to find or found a community for suport. I want make this kind of curriculum open to any one who want to learn. If the learners can pass some examination then they can be learning leaders in our community(<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/bioteahouse" target="_blank">BioTeaHouse</a>).</p>




<p>Well, before action, It is just an idea which is not new. So the point is to try and make it ture!</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2009/06/07/critical-thinking-and-constructional-suggestions</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we have many many info sources and much much information to check out. But it is still difficult for us to access the right info precisely and quickly. There are too much unrelated info to let out, and too much incorrect info to correct. And we should also learn to judge which info source is more comprehensive and which is just one-sided or even telling lies.</p>




<p>But before we learning  critical thinking, we should be able to have accesss to all the info sources. We need this kind of freedom to access more info sources, then we can have a more comprehensive view.  Having the ability of critical thinking is not  for just criticizing,  but to give constructional suggestions which help to make a change and let the thing on the right direction.</p>
