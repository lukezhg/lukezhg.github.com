    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A sample division for 40 pages paper.<br/>
2 Introduction<br/>
5-6 Literature<br/>
2 Theory/conceptual frameworks<br/>
6-10 Methods<br/>
4-12 Findings<br/>
10 Discussion conclusion Implication</p>

<p>(1)Introduction</p>

<pre><code>* what is known  
* what is unknown  
* Your burning Hypothesis, question, aim(Approach, plan of attack, proposed solution(a little bit),your experimental approach,why your study fills the gap  
</code></pre>

<p>tips for introduction</p>

<pre><code>* Keep short  
* for general audience: clear, concise, non-technical  
* take the reader step by step form what is know to what is unknown. end with your specific question  
* Emphasize how your study fills in the gaps(the unknown)  
* Summarize at a high level! Leave detailed descriptions, speculations, and criticism of studies in discussion  
</code></pre>

<p>Keep in minds:</p>

<pre><code>* it is not a literature review  
* catch attention  
* making the case  
</code></pre>

<p>(2)Literature review</p>

<pre><code>* comprehension  
* synthesis  
* critical  
* write the most important citations that stand your study out  
* anything in discussion should be here, no new paper add in discussion  
* one paragraph summary your review  
</code></pre>

<p>notes: if there is no directly related literature, you can close area to draw on, or standards, government policy</p>

<p>(3)Theoretical/ Conceptual Frameworks</p>

<pre><code>* help to analysis the data and approach the questions  
* theory -position/approach  
* conceptual model  
* theory drawing the studies
</code></pre>

<p>(4)Methods</p>

<pre><code>* Participants  
* Context  
* Data collections  
* Data analysis  
* Methodological theory  
* Reliability and validity  
* enough information for other people to repeat  
</code></pre>

<p>(5)Results<br/>
Tables and figures<br/>
Summarize not read table for reader<br/>
Highlight the result, Not only positive results but also negative<br/>
complement the information that is already in tables and figures<br/>
give precise values in the figure or the percentage change<br/>
don't forget to talk about the negative and control results<br/>
Reserve the term "significant" for statistically significant<br/>
reserve information about what you did for the methods section<br/>
do not discuss the rationale for statistical analyses within the results section<br/>
Reserve comments on the meaning of your results for the discussion section<br/>
Just tell what the data show not what your data mean</p>

<p>Use the past tense for completed actions: we found , women were, men smoked ,was<br/>
Use the present tense for assertions that continue to be true<br/>
figure 1 show ,  finds confirm the data suggests</p>

<pre><code>* Synthesis the important not all  
* Show the results to match the questions  
* select the most powerful and significant  
* do not repeat the tables and figures  
</code></pre>

<p>(6)Discussion<br/>
Answer the question you asked<br/>
Support your conclusion(your data, others' data)<br/>
Defend your conclusion(anticipate criticisms)<br/>
Give the "big-picture" take-home message<br/>
Connect your theory framework and review<br/>
how your work add on</p>
