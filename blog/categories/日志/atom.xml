    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes you want to run away confronting a challenge. Usually, you have your own reasons. It is too hard. It is too boring. I am not good at this. It is so painful. You want to advoid to meet it although it is important and urgent. We all know it but feel so hard to control yourself.</p>

<p>So what to do?</p>

<p>YOU have an imaginary enemy to fight. Game start! Sometimes your enemy is strong and sometimes he is endurable. Mostly, you have exaggerated your enemy and belittled yourself. Imagine you are fighting against an enemy who also have his own weakness. The wise move would be found his weakness and take all the advantage you have to beat him. If you don't fight, you are doomed to failure. If you fight, there still a hope to win.</p>

<p>In fact, you have no opotions but to fight. Your imaginary enemy would alert you and help you to beat the fearness and win the game!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>These days while I live in my apartment, I pay close attention to the daily life of people here. I have drawed a conclusion: Americans are lazy.</p>

<p>In fact, Lazy here is not used in a derogatory sense. You know, only the lazy people can invent and design a comfortable life. Americans are such kind of designers who are persueing simple but comfortable life. Let me give you some examples.</p>

<p>I live in a house department. In China, the parking area is often underground or a little far from the appartment. But in USA, the parking lot is jut in front of the hourse near the door. You can imagine when you get back from work, get out of your car, and then enter your door, it is so convinent.</p>

<p>After you get in, you can find a kitchen, a sitting room, a laundry room and a bath room. If you take a look at the kitchen, you will find a dish washer there and microwave oven. In China, most people just wash by hands, you can hardly found a dish washer, expecially in a student's department.</p>

<p>As to food, most food can be cooked just by heatting, like milk and bread. If sauces are needed, they are already mixed up and ready for use. You can find all this kind of mixed up sauces or semi-manufactured food everywhere in a food supermaket. Cooking become easy here, athough the taste may becoming a little dull. Most Chinese will not buy the mixed sauces, they may want to make their own although they will spent a lot of time on cooking.</p>

<p>One day, a ceaseless noise of machinery wake me up. I look out through the window, I found a man is using a grass cutter in front of the door. In China, people also use this kind of grass cutter, which is belted to the waist. But lawn mower like a car is hardly found in China. I often saw an american sitting on it and drive it on the lawn, it is fun. I also found people here clean the street in a differnt way, they use a air blower to blow the leaves away and make the road clean. If you walk on street in the early morning in Beijing, you will see a cleaner clean street with broom. You will never found a man with a blowing machine walk here and there.</p>

<p>And almost everyone have a car here. Once I ask a black man for directions, after telling my the way, he said don't you have a car, I sait not yet. He then added while it will be 20 to 30 minutes' walk. I follow his directions, after 10 minutes I got there. It is not that far, I said in my mind. May be they drive too much, and then have no idea how long it will take by walking.</p>

<p>So there are so many differences between the two countries. It also stand for different culture. The Americans are taking every advantage of modern science and technology to make their lives simple and comfortable. Labor is much more expensive in USA than in China. The Chinese culture advocate deligent, hard-working and Obedience.  The American culture advocate Science &amp; Technolgy, comfortable life and freedom. You can not say which one is better, but they can learn from each other.  Athough the American life is easy and comfortable, but it exhausted much more energy. Athough, Chinese food is delicious, but it is time cousuming, I think Chinese really should spend more time on inovation in S&amp;T and social system.</p>

    <id>http://lukezhg.github.com/blog/2013/08/02/dream-back-to-home</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I had a dream today. I took a flight back to home just in order to make sure everthing at home is Ok. I don't konw why. There is an old saying what you dream at night is what you think at day. Maybe I am a little homesick now. When I am awake, I am laying on a big white bed still in USA. I thought I will not easily be homesick, but I am wrong. Well my advisor is right, I will confront some hard time and even shed tears. If it was the Cost, what I can do is only maximize the benifit.</p>

<p>I have learnt how to cook rice in microwave oven. I also learn how to cook dishes in a pan which the bottom is flat.  I have been accustomed to the food here, milk and egg for breakfast, noodles or rice for lunch and supper. I improve my spoken and writing English through participting some online courses. It does work.</p>

<p>I will also record what I have done, observed and thought by bloging. It will cover all the stories that I experienced during my study in USA.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>我将在佐治亚访学一年，这一年的时间里我想用日志记录。记录我的所看、所感。</p>

<p>7月25号上午9点从上海飞往东京，转机飞亚特兰大。在东京停留了2个小时左右，我趁机买了一些日本的特产，包括绿茶和点心，这些小礼物是给接我的博士生R买的。一路上都很顺利，去亚特兰大的飞机上，坐在我左边的是一个中国人，右边的似乎是一个墨西哥人，很胖很壮，不过也很友善。我填写的海关表时，还向他借了笔，此外也问了他一些关于I94 departure record的问题，他回答的很耐心。</p>

<p>一路上我要莫看录像，要莫睡觉，为倒时差做准备。当然聊的比较多的还是与左边的中国留学生，他在英国留学，这次去美国看妈妈，我问他Groome shutle怎么坐，他说他也要做shutle，后来我给他看手机上的信息，结果其实他也是要做这个shutle的但是不是同一个线路而已。 于是我们商量好一起走。</p>

<p>从飞机下来要走很远，才能到海关检查的地点。然后排队等候，一个旅客无意识掏出了手机，结果给工作人员看见了，要求他拿着手机给检查官看，检查官是个黑人，盘问的半天检查了手机才让他继续排队。原因是这个地方是禁止拍照的。</p>

<p>盘查我的也是那个黑人警官，他问了2个问题，你来美国看什么，你研究什么，还让我出示了邀请信，之后才改了章放我过去。过了海关就去认领行李，一开始我以为应该有工作人员扫描条形码然后给我们行李，结果到了哪啥都没有，就是一个电子牌指示哪个航班的行李在哪个转盘上，我们等了半天，最后我的行李先出来了，由于我的班车是5点多的，我看了时间只有20分钟左右，我就自己先走了。 机场的地图虽然下载过，但是没什么用，有用的还是问路，问了一个警官，他告诉我做3路机场公车就可以，我赶紧去坐车，还好顺利赶到了。</p>

<p>我赶到的时候，只有2位乘客没有上车了，司机是个白人，长头发，很帅气，我告诉他我定了位置，他帮我放好行李，然后查看了记录手册，并让我付钱，结果我拿出一百美元，他说没有零钱。我问是否可以用信用卡，他说可以打电话，于是他帮我打通了电话，我说明了情况，报告了信用卡信息，结果就成功支付了。下车的时候，我看到有乘客给小费，但是很不巧我只有一百美元的，所以我说了谢谢，并解释了一下，他说没关系的。下车有机会再给吧。</p>

<p>我下了shutle，但是发现根本没有人等我，不过刚刚过了3分钟R先生就开车到了。我请他吃了快餐，本来还要买sim卡的，但是兜了很久也没找到，于是他送我去HSC入住。在工作人员的提示下，我填写了几张表格，就拿到了钥匙入住了。悬着的心终于放下来了，美国我来了。</p>
