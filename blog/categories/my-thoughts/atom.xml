    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven't thought out the name of the curriculum. But I do believe that begining teachers need a curriculum which specially designed for them.  The goal of this curriculum, may be not one but many, is to promote teachers' professional development. They can learn how to design a lesson, how to use science inquiry as a teaching strategy, how to reflect on thier teaching practices, how to write a article to publish, how to find or found a community for suport. I want make this kind of curriculum open to any one who want to learn. If the learners can pass some examination then they can be learning leaders in our community(<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/bioteahouse" target="_blank">BioTeaHouse</a>).</p>




<p>Well, before action, It is just an idea which is not new. So the point is to try and make it ture!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we have many many info sources and much much information to check out. But it is still difficult for us to access the right info precisely and quickly. There are too much unrelated info to let out, and too much incorrect info to correct. And we should also learn to judge which info source is more comprehensive and which is just one-sided or even telling lies.</p>




<p>But before we learning  critical thinking, we should be able to have accesss to all the info sources. We need this kind of freedom to access more info sources, then we can have a more comprehensive view.  Having the ability of critical thinking is not  for just criticizing,  but to give constructional suggestions which help to make a change and let the thing on the right direction.</p>
