J. Krishnamurti - Amsterdam 1981 - Public Talk 1 - Thought and time are the root of fear

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Z6IYtIEV9w&list=PL1n30s-LKus5uOY2xbRjAx_wPHnKvy_aW

I watched this talk in youtube and you can still find it at the URL above.   

###Thought is dangerous.
Why through hundred of years of evolution, mankind still can not solve the the problem such as wars, nationlism, fear and loneliness. Krishnamurti invited us to join him to think and investigate together.  

The first point of this talk is that we solve problems by our thought but thought can not solve the problem that created by thought. Thought is the root of all of these problems so we have to find another approach.  

There is a dead cycle of thought. We act by memories, memory is knowledge, knowledge is experiences, since we act by memories, memory create new experiences. So it is a cycle, a endless cycle. If we want to solve the problems created by thought, we have to jump out of this cycle.  

###Jump out of the thought cycle.
Do we have another approach to live our lives? Love might be the answer. But what is love? Love is not desire. Desire is created by thought. Desire is very close to thought. A couple may live together but they may never meet together spiritically even in bed. Human create images by thought, memories, knowledge. When there is an image of something or somebody, there is a desire and will. It creates problems. If there is an envy, control, attachment, there is no love, but an illusion of love that created by thought, by images, by memories.   

In order to solve this problem, we must not depend on anybody, any books, any mentors, but depend fully on yourself. Instead of reject, escape, worship, we observe with our sensation. We spend our energy on observing it, just on and fully on observing it. Then it will disapper, it might be fear, sorrow, loneliness and so on. When there is sorrow, there is no intelligence. When there is desire, there is no love.    

We cannot depend on thought, memories, knowledge to solve these interword problems. Thought can not solve the problems if the problems are created by thought. All knowledge is incomplete. Because if there is a desire, an image, a thought, the sensation become a slave of thought and observe what thought want to observe and ignore what thought want to ignore. So in this sense, love is not knowledge.  

When we observe it closely, we will find that thought is a process of time, past or future, not now. Through our brain and mind, we memory, we plan and we worry about something. We lost the feeling ability of present. We lost in the dead cycle of mind, thought.

###Ironically, we have to live with our thought system.

We want to jump out of the endless cycle of thought. Ironically, we also have to depend on the intelligence and language, to help ourselves to realize it and jump out of it. What we do is not deny thought, or reject thought. No thought is thought. If there is a will, there is no meditation. If you seek no thought, no thought itself is a thought. In order to jump out of it, you learn to live with it, even using it to inspire others.
