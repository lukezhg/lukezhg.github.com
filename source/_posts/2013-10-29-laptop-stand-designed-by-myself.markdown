It is uncomfortable to work on my laptop on a table. Becuase the screen is too low and you have to bend your head which cause pain in the neck.  
So I made a laptop stand using a useless shoes box. Here is the picture.

You can alway make a change if you want to. And small change can make a big difference sometimes.
