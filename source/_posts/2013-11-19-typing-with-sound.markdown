Nowardays people spend a lot of time in front of their computer. Most of the time they have to use their eyes whether they are typing or sufing on the internet.  

But when you are using computer too much you will find your eyes hurt. Lots of students get short-sighted. A idea come to me, why not close my eye to type in front of a computer. Is it possible, may be ti is possible. So I try to find a sofware to help me to do this job. I find a one, and it works. Now I can sit in front of my computer and keep my eyes closed and typing wha I want to say. Isn't it amazing. This software will also help blind peaple to type, because it can sound the key so they can hear what they are typiing.  

For me, it just helps to rest my eyes and concentrate on what I am writing.  

This is not a new idea, but if is an intersting idea.  

The above paragraph is written by me blindly.  

Another idea interesting is using your left hand to control the mouse and use your right hand to click. This will help you to coordinate your left brain and right brain.  

Now I am using the sound of pinyin to help myslef to type this paragraph. The pinyin sound help to pronounce a word when you are typing. It may not sound very right but it can do give a similar sound of the the word.  

Is not it amazing.

I write of course with my eye open and without any sound. I confront the same problem again. I am wonderring what i can do with the mouse, computer interaction, becuase my fingers hurts when using mouse click too many times, I just wonder how this problem can be solved. I try to use both hands to use mouse, and now both my Forefinger hurts. Maybe I use computer too much. I admit that but there are also some problem with the design, the mouse design, or the user-computer interaction design. There are several ways to solve this problem:  
1 redesign the mouse  
2 redesign how computer react to the mouse  
3 use keyboard instead of the mouse  
4 forget the computer and use paper and pencil instead  

The first two solutions are engineers and designers job.  
The third is my job(the user habits)  
The last one is not a solution for this problem but a solution for stopping the pain

I find out another solution already provided--but I did not discover before, using the touch pad of the computer. It is a solution,may be not perfect, because the user experience and the coceptural model is not what I want. It is also interesting that the user sometime ignore what had been provided.
