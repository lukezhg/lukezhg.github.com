Research on effective instruction() indicates that effective instruction is based on adaption of curriculum and materials to local settings and particular learning goals. in other words, effective teachers think about what they are currently doing, assess the results of their practice, explore with each other new possibilities  for teaching students, and are able to consider students' perspectives.
