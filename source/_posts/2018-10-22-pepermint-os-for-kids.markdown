Happy asked again.    
>Dad, did you update my laptop?   
>No, I said.   
>Ok, It doesn't matter I will give you one more day.   
>Thank you.  

Today, I did update his laptop computer. In fact, I changed his OS from sugar lab to Peppermint. I am not sure if this new system suits him. But I did my job anyway.  

I should upload a picture here for happy.
