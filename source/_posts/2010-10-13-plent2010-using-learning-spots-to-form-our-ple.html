<p>In order to learn, we go to many<br />
spots to seek info and build connections with co-learners, like elgg,<br />
moodle,twitter hash tag, flikr group and so on. I used to join google<br />
groups to learn how to use Python( a programing language). These are<br />
all learning spots. We build our PLE by visiting these spots and shape<br />
our learning networks.</p>

<p>The following links can be a kind of Navigation:<br />

<p>Soon many other spots will appear, I belive.</p>

<p>Important skills to use learning spots:</p>

<p>    * Ask a question and then find related info and figures, try to form a meaningful dialogue and build connections.<br />
    * Join the discussion that have your eyes.<br />
    * Start from familar spots and then go to unfamilar spots.</p>
