The materials our group used:  
  1. 5 bottles of coco (4 diet coco, 1 coco)  
  1. 25 memos(5 fruit memos and 20 memos)  
  1. 5 ml salt  
  1. 1 measurer ruler  
  1. 1 funnel  

The 5 cocos were used as 5 experiment as control, coco, fruit memos, flat, salt. We measured the height of the coco before and after experiment, so we could count how much coco get out of the bottle. Here is what we got.
