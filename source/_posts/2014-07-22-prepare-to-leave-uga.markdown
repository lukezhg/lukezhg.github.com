There is alway a lot more to learn. Athough I have been studying in UGA for 12 months, I still want to stay longer and learn more here. I like the beautiful campus and quiet main library, I also enjoy professors' classes and my classmates. Yes, I had a lot of fun here. But it is the time to say goodbye now.  

After ten years, I think I will still remember the trees,the people, and the stories.
