I just received the Stanford [Online Course Statement of Accomplishment Of DTAL from Novoed](https://novoed.com/designthinking/statement/76155).  

I also accomplished another similar course [Designing a New Learning Environment](https://novoed.com/education/statement/76155)  

I had spent 5~10 hours per week on each course. In fact, I didn't expect to accomplished them and got certificates. They just appeared interesting and related with my work. So I tried my best to take the boat and take every advantages of  the learning oportunities and resources. But the statments of accomplishment do encourage me to take more similar courses, so they are powerful in this sense.
