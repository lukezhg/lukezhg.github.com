One of the most deep impressions I got of US is the pursuing of simple and comfortable life.  

First is the bus design.  
There is a button out side of the bus that customers can push to kneel the bus. Another design is that there is a string along the windows. You can pull the string to let bus stop. You don't even need to stand up.  

Another interesting thing I discovered the yellow alert along the road. First I though it is to let people wark accross the street. But when I look into it carefully, It said "State law: stop when human on the line", it is for the car. No wonder evertime when I was on the line, the drive will stop let me pass first. What a nice law!

One day, when I was on my way home from supermarket, I found there is an American Bank ATM special for car drivers near the shops. I have never saw such ATM before in China. You don't have to get out of your car when you using the ATM In China, when you go to banks, usually you have wait for half an hour to get your turns in Shanghai. Why it is so different! This is a really good question to think about.  

The last discovery is kitchen. They have kitchen not only in the apartment where I live but also in the office. There is a special kitchen room for professors and students to heat their lunch or make coffee. So nice!  
Oh, I nearly forget. The water ﻿purifier﻿. It is so cool and useful, I love it too much.

It is evident that the goal of American people is to pursue a simple and comfortable life. Maybe not very luxurious but comfortable.  

How did they achieve that, market and competition may be the driving power. What it doesn't happen in China? Big question!
