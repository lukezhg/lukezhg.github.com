I had a dream today. I took a flight back to home just in order to make sure everthing at home is Ok. I don't konw why. There is an old saying what you dream at night is what you think at day. Maybe I am a little homesick now. When I am awake, I am laying on a big white bed still in USA. I thought I will not easily be homesick, but I am wrong. Well my advisor is right, I will confront some hard time and even shed tears. If it was the Cost, what I can do is only maximize the benifit.  

I have learnt how to cook rice in microwave oven. I also learn how to cook dishes in a pan which the bottom is flat.  I have been accustomed to the food here, milk and egg for breakfast, noodles or rice for lunch and supper. I improve my spoken and writing English through participting some online courses. It does work.  

I will also record what I have done, observed and thought by bloging. It will cover all the stories that I experienced during my study in USA.
