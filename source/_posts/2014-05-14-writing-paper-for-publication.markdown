Writing is an very important skill as speaking. It aims to send message, from people to people, from generation to generation, from country to country. One of the most efficient way to do this is publishing in good journals. Nowadays, publication has become a crucial part of resume or CV, and people write papers not just for sending messages but also seeking for promotions. So good universities ask faculties for good papers; good researchers look for good journals to publish. Good journals want good impactors or indexes. Good researchers tend to cite more good papers from good journals. But can this system help sending necessary message to those in-need audiences? It may not necessarily be the case. It is just a game of numbers dominated by the for-profit companies and ambitious universities who care little what the content really mean.  

Complain is enough. We still have to write anyway. But I believe we are writing for our audiences not for universities or journal companies. We write because we have the impulse to share. As a beginning researcher, I'd like to co-write with partners at first. I can learn easier and faster by observing the writing process and talking to them about it. So I would also recommend you co-write with somebody at first.  

Although you may not like the game, it is still good to know the rules and the tools. Here are some useful resources for writhing educational journals:  

I found writhing is both hard and complicated. It is like a hedgehog rolls itself as a ball; you can hardly approach anyhow. First it is hard because it is hard. Especially if you don't write often, it takes time to develop your own writing skills. Second, it is complex and complicated. Writhing a paper may include many small jobs: reading, citing, linking, analyzing, reasoning, revising, formatting, managing. It will remain hard unless you cut the job into small pieces that you can play with; Cutting tasks is a crucial managing skill. 

###Writing tips:  
    * Write down your thoughts while you read.  
    * Write it down when it come up to you.  
    * Write timely before the deadline.  
    * Write summary periodically.  
    * Write, and then shut down disturbs.  
    * Write with your ear, your mouth, and anything that helps.  
    * Write briefly and clear; Every word tell.  
    * Write as yourself and to be yourself.  
    * Write as you are talking to a friend about your new discovery(emotion)  

###Writing steps:  
    1  abstract, title, journal  
    2  results, logic, 5pages  
    3  enrich each paragraph and link together  
    4  revise and formatting  

###What make a paragraph good  
Focus on one idea  
Format paragraph  
  -Topic sentence  
  -explanation evidence logic  
-not too long: 3 sentences  
-Concluding/Beginning sentence  
-Paragraph work together  
-unity(pronoun, sense, tongue)  


###What make good sentence  
-no cluster, brief, clear, concise every word tell  
-use strong verb  
-make it colorful  

###The hard thing:  
When you are wrting,it is hard to make the right decisions:  
when to quit (something you don't want to do now);  
when to search for help (something necessary but you can't do yourself);  
when to just do the job no matter you like it or not.  

###Writing tools:  
[Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) can help you co-write online.  
[Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/) can help you manage your references.  
[HisCite](http://interest.science.thomsonreuters.com/forms/HistCite/) can make graph to let you know how paper cited each other.  
[SPSS](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/) can help you analyze the data.  
[LaTeX](http://latex-project.org/intro.html) is a good document preparation system especially useful when you have lots of equations and graphs(generated with R).  
There are lots of other text editors such as Miscro-soft Word, EditPlus for consider.

###NARST Proposal Review Rubric  
(from [NARST website](http://www.narst.org/))  
<pre><code>
For each category, three criteria are required. Given the constraints of the 5-page limit
