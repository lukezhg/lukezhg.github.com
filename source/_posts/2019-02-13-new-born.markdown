I do it for myself. But where is myself. If myself doesn't exist,then I do it for who. I do it not for myself, because myself doesn't exist. I do it not for someone else, because someone else also doesn't exist. I do it not for all, because all also do not exist. Should I stop? No. I do it for no reason, for nobody, for no aim. Just do it as it shoud be done.
