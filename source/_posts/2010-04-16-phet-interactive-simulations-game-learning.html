<p>PhET项目主页：<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://phet.colorado.edu/index.php">http://phet.colorado.edu/index.php</a><br /><br />该项目是科罗拉多大学为促进科学学习而开发的一系列的交互式模拟软件，包括物理、化学、生物、地学以及数学等科目。这些软件经过严格的评估，相信对于科学教师和学习者会很有帮助。<br /><br />这些模拟软件的地址在：<a target="_blank" href="http://phet.colorado.edu/simulations/index.php?cat=Featured_Sims">http://phet.colorado.edu/simulations/index.php?cat=Featured_Sims</a><br /><br />生物主题的一些模拟软件：<br /><a target="_blank" href="http://phet.colorado.edu/simulations/index.php?cat=Biology&amp;st=-1">http://phet.colorado.edu/simulations/index.php?cat=Biology&amp;st=-1</a><br /><br />以下是关于PhET项目的介绍：<br /><blockquote>PhET Interactive Simulations is an ongoing effort to provide an extensive suite of simulations to improve the way that physics, chemistry, biology, earth science and math are taught and learned.&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/simulations/index.php">simulations</a> are interactive tools that enable students to make connections between real life phenomena and the underlying science which explains such phenomena.&nbsp; Our team of scientists, software engineers and science educators use a <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/research/index.php">research-based approach</a> – incorporating findings from prior research and our own testing – to create simulations that support student engagement with and understanding of scientific concepts. <p>In order to help students visually comprehend these concepts, PhET simulations animate what is invisible to the eye through the use of graphics and intuitive controls such as click-and-drag manipulation, sliders and radio buttons.&nbsp; In order to further encourage quantitative exploration, the simulations also offer measurement instruments including rulers, stop-watches, voltmeters and thermometers.&nbsp; As the user manipulates these interactive tools, responses are immediately animated thus effectively illustrating cause-and-effects relationships as well as multiple linked representations (motion of the objects, graphs, number readouts, etc…).</p><p>To ensure educational effectiveness and usability, all of the simulations are extensively tested and evaluated.&nbsp; These tests include student interviews in addition to actual utilization of the simulations in a variety of settings, including lectures, group work, homework and lab work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/about/legend.php">rating system</a> indicates what level of testing has been completed on each simulation. </p><p>All PhET simulations are freely available from the <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/index.php">PhET website</a> and are easy to use and incorporate into the classroom. They are written in <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/tech_support/support-java.php">Java</a> and <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/tech_support/support-flash.php">Flash</a>, and can be run using a standard web browser as long as <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/tech_support/support-flash.php">Flash</a> and <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/tech_support/support-java.php">Java</a> are installed. </p><br /><div id="footer"> <p>© 2009 University of Colorado. <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/about/licensing.php">Some rights reserved.</a></p> </div></blockquote>          <br /><br /><br /><br /><div class="zemanta-pixie"><img class="zemanta-pixie-img" alt="" src="http://img.zemanta.com/pixy.gif?x-id=1af991bb-b90c-801a-a87d-3dd2fdb04c57" /></div></p>
