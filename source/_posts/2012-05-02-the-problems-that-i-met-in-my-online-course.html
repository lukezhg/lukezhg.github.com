<p><p>This term I start the course Micro-Teaching at the Fool's Day( April 1st ). I used 2 hours to deliver what and how to learn in this curriculum. I introduced what teaching skills should students develope in the end. The online platform such as wikispaces, haokanbu, googlegroups were mentioned but not introduced in detail.</p>
<p>And I met the following problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>students say it is time consuming and &nbsp;they don't have enough time</li>
<li>some of them feel hard to use this tools</li>
<li>they lack of the experiences and habits of online learning</li>
<li>some can't find and join the related resources and dialogues</li>
</ul>
<p>What I want to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>foucus on the most important and effective online activies</li>
<li>provide tool guides and success examples</li>
<li>habits feedback</li>
<li>reoranize the information deliver methods</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope these measures can be helpful.</p></p>
