Recently I attended Dr Luft's class Methods of Science Teaching. I am becoming more and more interested in Modeling activities and I want to make a collection of these activities.  

This is the list:  
-	Candle in the water tube make it go out(Dr Luft's class)  
-	Black box([How students learn: science in classroom](http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11102) see Chp 12)  
-	Timms video [JP5 AIR COMPRESSION AND EXPANSION](http://timssvideo.com/72)  
-	Secret Tube (Dr C's class)  
-	Next Generation Science Standards [simulation activities in Concord](http://concord.org/ngss/)  
If you have more good modeling activities, welcome recommandations.  

These activities provide lots of practice options for science teachers. We usually only provide standards of what students should master but little practice activites for teachers. Well, the [Next Generation Standard](http://www.nextgenscience.org/next-generation-science-standards) is going to change this.  

Reflections on Modeling in science teaching  
The charm of modeling:  
-	Naturally need students to make careful observation,recording data,drawing conclusions  
-	Naturally engage students' prior ideas for explaination or application  
-	Naturally put students into the test, debate and revisement of their models or prior ideas  
-	Naturally let students experience the full process of science inquiry and nature of science  

What to focus in the modeling activites as a science teacher?

How to keep the balance between knowledge-centered and student-centered? Individual and Community? Cognition and metacognition?  

Welcome to join the discussion of these open questions!
