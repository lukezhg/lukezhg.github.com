I am very interested in robot. I believed that someday it can play a very important role in our society and personal life.  

There are many amazing things that robot can do. They become more clever and skilled in lots of feild: Some robots talk; Some walk; Some can carry; Some fly; Some can drive; Some teach; Some have expressions; Some have skins.  

Today I watched a TED video in which robots help Henry -- a stroke patient -- regain his life.

What robot can do? It depends on what they are used for. In the global market, if you want a awesome job, learn and do something that robots can't do.
