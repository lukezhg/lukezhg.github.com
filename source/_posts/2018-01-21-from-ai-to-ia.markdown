AI stands for Artificial Intelligence.  
IA stands for Intellectual Assistant. 

We don't need AI. We need IA.  

AI sounds amazing but hard to understand for common computer users. Even for programers it take time and effort to fully understand and make use of AI power.   

AI includes many sub-feilds, such as machine learning, natural language processing, expert system and so on. As an amateur programer, what I really need is not AI but an assisstant to help me learn and work. I call it intellectural assisstant (IA).  

IA make use of AI power to recognize friends' faces, remember ceremony days, record your life experiences and predict your personal needs and action. IA is not a technology method, it is your personal smart accompany.
