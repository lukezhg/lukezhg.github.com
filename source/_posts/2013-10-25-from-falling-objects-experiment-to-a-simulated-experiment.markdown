Today I attened the Science Method class. An interesting question discussed was the experiment of falling objects-the [Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo%27s_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa_experiment).  Dr. Luft provided us some students' responses and let us to figure out the students' thinking and how to response to students properly.  

But the question caught my curiosity in the class was two ice cube droping from the same inclination.

I asked my classmates what happens in the following situations.

I acturally did the experiment using [simulation environment](http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/energy-skate-park).  

The result is interesting. Ball B frist arrived at the bottom with lest time.(The first two curves are situation A; Next two curves are situation B)

Ball A is the second arrived. Ball C is the last one.   
From Leaning Tower of Pisa Experiment to simulated experiment, what a big change information technology has made to our science teaching and learning!

In fact, David Scott-Astronaut of  Apollo 15-recreated Galileo's famous experiment on the Moon by Hammer and Feather Drop.

You see the space technology also expanded our learning experience and provided us an amazing teaching resource-a dicrepant event.
