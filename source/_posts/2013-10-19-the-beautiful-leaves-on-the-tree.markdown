On a grassy lawn near the road, standed a little girl about five years old. She was looking up at the colorful tree leaves and jumping to reach them. She jumped up using all her energy but found herself still get nothing.  

I walked close to the girl-she was really a beautiful angel.  

"Do you need help?" I asked.  
She stared at me with her shinning black eyes without saying a word.  
"Do you want some leaves? I can help!" I repeated.   
"No" she answered.   
"I can use the ball." She fetched a ball from the ground just several steps away.  
"then the leaves will fall."  
"You are very clever!" I said.  
After I left, she began throw the ball up to the leaves again and again - very exitedly.  

Well, she may never heared of the term "gravity", but she do have been aware of it and even make use of it to get the beautiful leaves.
