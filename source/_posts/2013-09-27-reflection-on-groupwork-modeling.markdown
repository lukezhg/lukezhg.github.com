I have wrote several posts about modeling:  
Such as [Interactive simulation based inquiry activities](/blog/2013/08/24/interaction-simulation-based-inquiry-activities/)  
Look for more click [here](/tag/modeling/)  

But this time I would rather to think modeling from the groupwork perspective.  

As a teacher, we should keep in mind that groupwork can only be flowers while big science ideas are the real fruits. The big flowers don't guaranteed the fruits are big.  

Groupwork tasks take times, so they must be well designed and organized.   

What do I mean by well designed? The groupwork should meet the following preconditions:  
1.  It is highly realated with the science idea that student are going to learn.  
2.  It is challenging enough that it can't be done individually.  
3.  It is reachable for students with their present knowledges and skills.  
4.  It generates meaningful discussions and productive outcommings.  

What do I mean by well organized? The teacher should do the following:  
1.  Students' prior idea should be explored and addressed.  
2.  Possiblely related science theories or ideas should be put on the table(eg by brainstorming).  
3.  All group members should engaged actively and equally in the task.  
4.  Students can learn to communicate and collaborate like scientists.  
5.  Competition can be used to save time and for fun.  

How to help students to generate more productive group conversation?  
1.  State proper questions or the tasks clearly. Everyone knows what to do.  
2.  Use deep silent thinking and wide brainstorm, Enage what students prior ideas and concepts to expain the data/phenomenon? Everyone needs to participate in group conversation in some way.  
3.  Visualize group ideas or models with tools and posters.  
4.  Test and Review the models critically and make suggestions.  
5.  Revise the models in light of new data and feedbacks from class community.
