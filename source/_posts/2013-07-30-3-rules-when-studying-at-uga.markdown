Durying my study in UGA, I will obey 3 rules:  
*   能在中国做的不在美国做 Things that can be done in China will not be put at the frist place.  
*   能自己做的不让别人做   Things that I can do myself will not be done by others.  
*   能一天做的不用两天做   If it only need one day, I will not spend two days.  

The aim of these rules is to let me to take every advantage of my study here. They will help me to save time and focus on the important work.
