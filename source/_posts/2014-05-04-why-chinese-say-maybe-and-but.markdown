I watched a TED recently that Sarah Jones(a actress) played the role of 11 people from different cultures to response to random questions asked by TED audiences.

I was impressed by the Chinese American woman she played who always repeat "BUT" and "Maybe". It heard like a typical Chinese speaker. I began to think why Chinese people tend to say these two words again and again. One reason is that they are not good at express themselves. The second reason might be they are not confident; they feel insecurity. She said that at least the food should not be poison. As you know, food, sex and sacurity are the basic needs of human according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs.

Why Chinese people are lack of sacurity. Well, it is a long story. To make it brief---it is becuase poisonous food, polluted air and water, dominated culture and so on. A survey report that many rich people in China want to imgrant to other country such as US, Canada. Some Corrupt officials want to have orther country's identity because they want to escape from the punishment. There also a lot of people want to go US, becuase they worry about the nature and social environment, they worry about the education and healthy of their children.
