We have been in BC for 3days. Everything is new for our ECNU students, the beautiful campus of UBC, the long NO 44 bus, the comfortable Landmark hotel, the nice professors and staffs, the exciting learning activities.  

Today is even special. We went to visit a middle school called [Norma Rose Point School](http://go.vsb.bc.ca/schools/normarosepoint/Pages/default.aspx). The school is not far from UBC, in fact it is the neighborhood of UBC. It took us about 20 or 30 minutes to walk there from Scarfe building where our classroom located. There are about six hundreds of students in the school, from kindergarten to grade 8, including both elementary and secondary education. This school is very unique because of its educational rationals and teaching building design.

They believe learning should be integrated and take place in communities instead of separated and in classrooms of each discipline. They want to give student a whole picture of the world and want them to experience this by themselves in their learning communities. In this way, students get better understanding of who they are, where they come form, how they will change the world around them. They will also take more responsibility of their learning and be proactive to inquiry the world around them rather listen to the teacher and memorize for tests.

The learning schedule and activities are designed and carried out by a faculty team but not a single teacher as traditionally school usually do. The teacher love this kind of collaborative teaching, it also give teacher many opportunities to learn from each others. It is much easier for new teacher to join the team to teach together. As you can see, they value collaboration very much. Student collaborate with student, teachers and even parents. Teacher collaborate with colleges, parents, and university professors. Student who are good at something can teach others. Teacher can do the same thing. They are all super heroes at that time. Super hero is a learning activity designed by the 4th grade teacher team which engage students and let them rethink what a hero means.

Many features of the school building reflect educational wisdom. They make a window to let student who play basketball to look downstairs and notice what is happening in the football playground. All the classrooms are open without a door but only three or two walls. It means guests are always welcome to join or observe the class. There are also lots of art crafts made by student to show their understanding of their school spirits.

It is hard to believe such an ideal school can exist and survive. ARE there any disadvantages and challenges for this kind of school? Of course there are, but who can deny their bold spirit and unique learning place design. It is beautiful! That is enough for now!
