When I was wandering around in Vancouver BC last month, I found a art gallery along the Howe Street by chance. It is called LeSoleil Fine Art Gallery.  

It was raining and I had some time, so I decided to have a look inside of the gallery. One artist's painting named "That Night the Magic Mirror" attracted my attention. The artist's name is Cecilia Aisin-Gioro (爱新觉罗.恒钦). She is the grandniece of the last Chinese Emperor Pu Yi Aisin-Gioro.

You can find more paintings of her [here](http://lesoleilfineart.com/cecilia-aisin-gioro).  

At my first look of the picture, the woman is very beautiful and youthful, but herself in the mirror seems less energetic. When you look the picture carefully, you will found a mistake(or unnatural phenomenon) in the picture. Take your time to have a look.  

The woman have two left arms, one you can see directly, one in the mirror, without right arm. What does Cecilia want to say? or it is just a mistake?   

The other thing I don't like is the face in the mirror. It is flat and dull comparing with her real face.  

So I changed it like this.
