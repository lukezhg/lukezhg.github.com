After a happy time of lunch, Julie drive us to see a tree that owns itself. It took us only several minutes to get there from the Grit.  

Here is the picture of the tree.

The owner of the nearby house loved this tree too much, he wanted to protect the tree as long as possible. So he claimed that he conveyed the right of this tree and nearby land to this tree itself.  

The view of values of Americans are well presented in the story of this tree. They love and respect nature and the natural organism. They also respect and trust laws. There are more willing to share and respect other peoples' love and willings.  

This cultural values may answer at least partly the questions: why the sky is still blue and the water is still clean; why birds sing in the morning and squallers run around; why people like to go nature for holiday and spend more money to buy green electricity.  

This may be the big thing that China lacks and we want to rebuild, in both Chinese culture and education system.
