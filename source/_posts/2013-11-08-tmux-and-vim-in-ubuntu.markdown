Learning to use a new language is not easy. Learning to use all the shortcut keys of TMUX and VI also takes time.  

Today, I want to record what I had learnt about TMUX and Vi.  

While, I should divided this post into two posts, but TMUX only takes a little ink, so I just put it here.  

TMUX is a tool to help you divide your screen of your terminals into several screens. Whenever you want to use hotkeys, you have to press Ctrl + B first, then you can press the hot key. You can change the pre hot key, but I just leave it unchanged. The most used keys are the following:  
REMEMBER to press Ctrl+B first!!  
	%  #divide screen left and right  
	"  #divede screen up and down  
	Ctrl + Down #make the down screen smaller  
	exit #cancel present screen  
	n  #new dash window  

That is it.  

Then let me record the tips of VI. Well it is much complex than the former. Generally, it has three mode, i mode(insert and edit), v mode(copy and paste), and : mode(file operation). Ok let me write down the most used keys:  
	Ctrl +: #this will let you enter the file operation mode  
	i       #this will let you enter the edit mode, Press Esc to enter : mode  
	v       #this will let you enter copy and paste mode, Press Esc to enter : mode  

When you press 'v' in the : mode, you can press Arrow Button to select the text you want to copy or delete, and then press:  
	y       #copy  
	d       #delete
	p       #paste  
	Ctrl+:  #show clipped board  
	:%s/ski/sky/g  #replace ski with sky in all place  

How to save file  
	:w filename
	:w! filename
	:wq #quit and save
	:q! #quit not save

How to open file
	:open filename
	:open ~/luke/code/try.py  

How to search in a file  
	:/ pattern  
	:? pattern  
	n:search next  
	N:search previous  

How to cancel and redo  
	:u  for cancel  
	Ctrl + R：redo  

How to paste from system clipboard  
	shift+insert  
	+p  

	
Isn't easy. But it takes time to get used to them and operate unconsioucely.  

I also want to keep down some hot keys of Ubuntu, let me google first. Ok here are they:  
	Ctrl + Alt + L     lock the desktop  
	Win                applications desktop  
	Ctrl + Alt + Left  shift to left desktop  
	Alt + Tab          shitt applications  
	Alt + F4           shut down present application  
	Ctrl+Win+Up        Maxilize present window  
	Ctrl+Win+Down      Minilize presnet window  
	Ctrl+Alt+T         Open terminal
	$ command1 && command2 # execute command1 first and succeed then execute command2  
	Ctrl+Shift+Arrow   Shift Workplace  
	Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Arrow   move present window to Workplace
