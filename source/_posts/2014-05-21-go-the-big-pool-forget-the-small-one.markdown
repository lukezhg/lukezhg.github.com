It is so amazing to swim in the big pool; You are just like a fish swimming in the ocean. The water is clear; you can see everything in the water. It also takes less effor swimming in a big pool; you swim faster and faster with passion. Forget the small pool, come to this one.  

It usually opens from 11 AM to 1 PM during weekdays. Enjoy it and have fun!
