    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we have many many info sources and much much information to check out. But it is still difficult for us to access the right info precisely and quickly. There are too much unrelated info to let out, and too much incorrect info to correct. And we should also learn to judge which info source is more comprehensive and which is just one-sided or even telling lies.</p>




<p>But before we learning  critical thinking, we should be able to have accesss to all the info sources. We need this kind of freedom to access more info sources, then we can have a more comprehensive view.  Having the ability of critical thinking is not  for just criticizing,  but to give constructional suggestions which help to make a change and let the thing on the right direction.</p>
