    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I haven't thought out the name of the curriculum. But I do believe that begining teachers need a curriculum which specially designed for them.  The goal of this curriculum, may be not one but many, is to promote teachers' professional development. They can learn how to design a lesson, how to use science inquiry as a teaching strategy, how to reflect on thier teaching practices, how to write a article to publish, how to find or found a community for suport. I want make this kind of curriculum open to any one who want to learn. If the learners can pass some examination then they can be learning leaders in our community(<a href="https://groups.google.com/group/bioteahouse" target="_blank">BioTeaHouse</a>).</p>




<p>Well, before action, It is just an idea which is not new. So the point is to try and make it ture!</p>
