    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally find a swimming poor that I can have access in UGA. It is in the Remsey Center just take the next stop of Aderhold by East-West School Bus. I purchased a membership for three months($15 per month). Today I went there to work out and swim. It is really worth every cents.</p>

<p>I took several pictures:<br/>

I often see people running on the road to do exercise. Sometimes man, sometimes old men stripped to the waist, sometimes women with young boy or girls. In fact, the road in Athens are not flat, so they have to run up and down. They really got the admirable sport spirits.</p>

The following is a picture of the swimming pool taken from a window.  The water is blue and there many students swimming like fish in the water.<br/>

<p>Today the climbing wall is open for free. It will be one day for free per month. So if you want to try, don't miss the boat. <br/>
