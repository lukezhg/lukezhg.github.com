    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Dr. Oliver let us read this following paper and write one or two paragraph of summary.<br/>
Nuthall, G. (2004). Relating Classroom Teaching to Student Learning: A Critical Analysis of Why Research Has Failed to Bridge the Theory-Practice Gap. Harvard Educational Review, 74(3), 273â€“307.</p>

<p>It is good paper to read, although it is a little long for non-native English speaker.</p>

<p>Here is what I got:</p>

Is this why western culture emphase qualitative studies than quantitative studies</p>

The precondition of this approach is that teacher education help teachers do so. So it should be one
topic in teacher education program.</p>

Teachers need an explanatory theory of the teaching-learning relationship that meets these
requirements in order to plan, carry out, and evaluate their daily activi- ties effectively and efficiently
(Floden, 2001; Levin &amp; ODonnell, 1999).

a theory of effective teaching is still needed in order to know when to look and what to look for when
you observe the teachers classroom activities.

best of these studies had two enormous advantages over previous research:
First, they were based on
systematic observation or audio- and video-recording of teacher and student behavior. Second,
independent measures of student learning that were directly related to the student experi- ences being
observed were used in almost all of the best studies.

Teachers themselves are not always good at rating student achievement, as their ratings tend to be
strongly affected by student behavior and motivation, crediting the most attentive and interested with
higher achievement (Gold- enberg, Gallimore, Reese, &amp; Garnier, 2001)

the problem of process-product studies or careless quantitative studies is a neglect of the context
and
other students not on the focus

The study, however, is of little use in advancing our knowledge about the teaching-learning relationship

I have already made the point that teachers cannot be aware of critical ele-
ments in the
teaching-learning process in their own classrooms unless they al- ready have a clear understanding of
what to look for and have additional ways of observing or recording the experiences of individual
students.W</p>

this is a problem

If you simply looked at the post-test totals, you would incorrectly assume that the more able learned
more than the less able.</p>

But it cannot produce generalizable knowledge (or an evi- dence based explanatory theory) of the
relationships between the alternative versions of the visible structure and the basis model (to use Oser
and Baeris- wyls model) that can be transferred from classroom to
classroom.</p>

It has been claimed that how students learn and how their learning is shaped by the actions of the
teacher is always unique and context dependent (Barab &amp; Kirschner, 2001; Bolster, 1983). This claim
is both true and not true. There
26 Chunlei Zhang Page no. 22
10/6/2014 3:04
Part of the professional knowledge of teachers must be the distinction between what is unique to a
specific context and what is generalizable across all stu- dents and/or contexts. While the latter is the
proper focus of research on the teaching-learning relationship, an adequate explanatory theory should
help us to distinguish between the two.
27 Chunlei Zhang Page no. 22

individual case studies of teaching, provided they include
data about student experience and learning
that can be directly connected to observations of specific classroom activities, can provide invaluable
insights into the processes that lie behind the teaching-learning relationship.
28 Chunlei Zhang Page no. 23

I believe that the professional knowl- edge base that is most needed to improve the quality of teaching
and teacher education is knowledge about the ways in which classroom activities, including teaching,
affect the changes taking place in the minds of students: what stu- dents know and believe and what
they can do with their knowledge (what I have called above practical explanatory theory). At the heart
of the problem that teachers face in the classroom is knowing what is going on in the minds of the
students (Steffe, Thompson, &amp; von Glasersfeld, 2000).
