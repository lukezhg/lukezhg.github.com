<p>Really Ridiculous, I can't help laughing when thinking of the great jump.<br/>
But sometimes it can be a very serious problem.</p>

If you are the designer of the break glass hammer. How can you make sure people can succeed to break the glass with the hammer. What data do you need to collect or search? What physics principles you want to apply? What experiment do you want to do? What observation you want to make? Who do you want to interview?<br/>

This is a serious problem, but also a good challenge for you to figure it out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>我有幸参与了Dr C的三次教法课，每次课一个小时。之所以第一次参与这个课堂，一个很直接的原因是我被一盆开的很漂亮的花吸引了，我想知道老师想用这盆花干什么。<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/2013-08-19-12.11.21.jpg" alt="漂亮的花朵" /></p>

<p>后面之所以继续参与课堂，则是因为我被课堂的活动吸引了，其中之一就是种子萌发这个活动。<br/>
其实种子萌发这个活动我们也中学也做，不过我中学没做过，因为当时考试不考。这次看外国本科生做这个活动，觉得很新鲜。老师到底想干嘛？<br/>
老师先让学生仔细关注天气预报中的信息，日期，温度，湿度，风力，天气等，那么这些变量可能与植物生长有什么关系呢？植物的生长受哪些因素的影响？如何影响呢？<br/>
带着这些问题，开始进行活动，每个人发一个透明的封口袋还有一些扁豆种子，然后在封口袋中放一张吸水纸，在底端1/3处用订书机打上一排钉子。然后将种子放进去，并且往里面添加一些水。写上姓名和日期。<br/>
这是第一次课8/19的照片：<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/2013-08-19-12.08.01.jpg" alt="8-19" /><br/>
这是第二次课8/26的照片：<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/2013-08-26-11.07.53.jpg" alt="8-26a" /><br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/2013-08-26-11.09.46.jpg" alt="8-26b" /> <br/>
这是第三次课8/30的照片：<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/2013-08-30-10.56.08.jpg" alt="8-30a" /><br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/2013-08-30-10.56.33.jpg" alt="8-30b" />
第二次课上还没开始前，老师的幻灯片上就要求每个同学对种子萌发的情况进行观察、测量、记录、绘图等。有的学生的种子疯长，有的则还是老样子。他们很兴奋的讨论着这些结果和可能的原因，有的说是温度，有的说是水，有的说是光，五花八门。  <br/>
第三次课上，老师在下课前布置了一个任务，每个学生要用一个大可乐瓶制作一个植物培养瓶，老师提供了样板，学生则需要设计一个实验检验自己的某个假设，可以组成小组合作设计和控制变量。</p>

<p>这些是大四的本科生，他们毕业后可能会当科学教师。这些活动不仅仅是关注在科学研究上，同时教师也在尝试传递Model-based Learning（基于模型的学习）的理念和实践。这不是说教式的探究，而是真刀真枪的用自己的教学方式践行理念。</p>

<p>American people and Unite States are good examples.</p>

<p>Here are some pictures evidence.<br/>
The first thing was the emergency chair at the corner of stairwell. You can break the window and use the chair to take somebody hurt going downstairs. What a considerate safety concern! You can find an emergency shower at every classroom, which hardly seen in Chinese classroom.<br/>

The safety shower is just at the right of the door.<br/>

<p>Im my apartment, there is a white notice like following.<br/>

<p>It doesn't look nice on the door. But it is there.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Why</h3>

<p>It is important for students to survive in such an era full of science and technology products and information.<br/>
It is also important for a country to have enough science literate talents and labors in order to survive in the global economy.<br/>
Why science important? You can go on reading another blog post<a href="http://www.letstalkscience.ca/about-us/why-science">Why science?</a></p>

<h3>We</h3>

<p>Science teacher is a career but also a job. They are playing the most important role in developing the science literacy of the next generation. We choose it and we do it.</p>

<h3>Teach</h3>

<p>Good teaching is not an accident. It is a pursely planed activity fiting students' needs and level.</p>

<h3>Science</h3>

<p>Authentic science not just includ scientific knowledge(facts, concepts, theories), but also the process of science and the nature of science.</p>

<h3>In school</h3>

<p>While school education system is still the dominant formal learning place today. So it is an crutial battle feild of science education. But science learning can happen anywhere not just in school.</p>

<h3>Why has science teaching changed over time?</h3>

<p>Science is changing everyday. New discovery, New papers, New theories and models, in fact science update itself everyday.<br/>
Student is changing every year. Students today are not like before. They have iphone, ipad, facebook. Even kids at the same age in different class response significant differently to the same question.<br/>
Society is changing too. It need more talents who are good at 4Cs: Communication, Collaboration, Critical thinking and Creativity.<br/>
Should science teaching keep the same as before? Never.</p>

<h3>How should science be taught in science classrooms?</h3>

<p>Well, It is really a hard question.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, I went to the Main library of UGA. I had a task to search a journal from 1980 to 1990. It was my first time to be there. To my suprise, nobody stopped me to check my UGA card. So I just went around and check out the journels. It means everybody can come in and take a seat to read. It is great! The frist floor is very big and open. The book and magzines are located in the center, surrounded by many groups of tables, seats and computers. Although many students studying there, it was very quiet. I ask a library staff how to find the journal, he helped me to check it out in his computer and told me it is located at the second floor and it is also available online. So I just came out. It was at the noon, I took a picture of the main library, it is beautiful. <br/>

I also found some interesting things at Aderhold where College of Education located. The first thing was the emergency chair at the corner of stairwell. You can break the window and use the chair to take somebody hurt going downstairs. What a considerate safety concern! You can find an emergency shower at every classroom, which hardly seen in Chinese classroom.<br/>

<p>When I entered the building in the morning, I found there were lots of names on the bricks. I guess there are the names of professors who had worked there. <br/>

<p>When I kept looking, I saw a brick which said: "stop read the bricks, go to study". I smiled and entered the building.</p>
