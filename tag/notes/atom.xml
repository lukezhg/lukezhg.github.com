    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education (Chickering &amp; Gamson, 1987):<br/>
1. Good practice encourages interaction between students and faculty.<br/>
2. Good practice encourages interaction and collaboration between students.<br/>
3. Good practice uses active learning techniques.<br/>
4. Good practice gives prompt feedback.<br/>
5. Good practice emphasizes time on task.<br/>
6. Good practice communicates high expectations.<br/>
7. Good practice respects diversity—talents, experience, and ways of learning.</p>

<p>Seven Learner-Centered Principles to Improve Teaching (Ambrose et al., 2010):<br/>
1. Students’ prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.<br/>
2. How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.<br/>
3. Students’ motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to learn.<br/>
4. To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned.<br/>
5. Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students’ learning.<br/>
6. Students’ current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning.<br/>
7. To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.</p>

<p>Principles based on brain science(Zull, 2002):<br/>
1. recognize the importance of emotion.<br/>
2. help students feel in control.<br/>
3. build on existing neuronal networks (prior knowledge), even if these networks are wrong.</p>

Research on effective instruction() indicates that effective instruction is based on adaption of curriculum and materials to local settings and particular learning goals. In other words, effective teachers think about what they are currently doing, assess the results of their practice, explore with each other new possibilities  for teaching students, and are able to consider students' perspectives.<br/>
