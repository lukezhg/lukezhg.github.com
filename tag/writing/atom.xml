    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Writing is an very important skill as speaking. It aims to send message, from people to people, from generation to generation, from country to country. One of the most effienct way to do this is publishing in good journals. Nowadays, publication has become a crucial part of resume or CV, and people write papers not just for sending messages but also seeking for promotions. So good universitis ask faculties for good papers; good researchers look for good journals to publish. Good journals want good impators or indexs. Good reseachers tend to cite more good papers from good journals. But can this system help sending necessary message to those in-need audiences? It may not necessarily be the case. It is just a number game dominated by the for-profit companies and ambitious universities who care little what the content really mean.</p>

<p>Complain is enough. We still have to write. But I believe we are writing for our audiences not for universitis and journal companies. We write because we have the impluse to share. As a begining researcher and writer, I'd like to co-write with others at first. I can learn easier by talk and write together. So I would also recommand you co-write at first.</p>

<p>Athough you may not like the game, it is still good to know the rules and some tools. Here are some useful resources for writhing educational journals:</p>
