    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this lovely week, our students enjoyed Tony's classes. WHY? Because Tony made it a lovely place to learn. HOW? In order to answer this question, I have to go back and inquiry Tony's classes and teaching practices. I hope I can recognize not only Tony's magic tricks but also his intentions behind. If I don't write it down, the ideas may disappear and never come up to my mind again. So the FRIST goal of this post is a reflection and a record for myself.</p>

<p>It is a challenging job to decode a teacher's class, especially Tony's complicated, multicultural and bilingual class in with many educational goals, skills and strategies were embedded. Fortunately, Tony provided some clues. The clues were written on the whiteboard or explicitly said by Tony.</p>

<h3>Monday 16th Nov, Hot Water Welcome</h3>

<p>After we got in the door of Scarf building, we saw a welcome poster for our ECNU students in the corridor. It is not big, but well printed and mounted with a frame. The next day, It was put on the wall of our classroom. There were two hot water containers prepared for us. So nice! [MAKING THE PLACE]</p>

<p>The thing we did in the morning was self-introduction. Tony provided some useful scaffoldings, a map of China, pins with student names and numbers, umbrellas and format of introduction. When TAs and faculties came, they introduced themselves too.[CONNECTING THE PEOPLE]</p>

<p>In the afternoon, students went to corridor to look around their own pictures printed by Tony. The pictures were chosen by students. They stand for students' image of teaching or learning and also have special meaning for themselves. After they got back, they share a picture and the reasons why they choose it to share. Tony would welcome other students to make comments too. Then the picture owner reveal its meaning or story. [ENGAGING THE STUDENTS]</p>

<h3>Tuesday 17th Nov, Placed Based Learning</h3>

<p>Natalie introduced the place at different levels, Vancouver, BC, Canada, Turtle island, the Indigenous. Place based learning aim to make this change from I AM NO WHERE to I AM NOW HERE. Place represents layers of stories and it can included ecological education, bioregional education, critical pedagogy, experiential education, indigenous ways of knowing and being. Place based learning connects people and their places. It disrupts the idea of a one size fits all curriculum. Place is not about where we lived, buy rather about how we live where we live. Wisdom also sits in places. So our learning should not take place without a place.[PRESENT THE CONCEPTION]</p>

<p>Place based learning should answer three questions:</p>

<pre><code>WHAT IS WHERE  
WHY IS IT THERE  
WHY SHOULD I CARE  
</code></pre>

<p>Students explored the place around Scarf building in UBC. They must interview someone about the place and sit down some where in the building silently for 5 minutes to feel the place. Every group of 4 people needed to take 3 pictures and answer the three questions.[EXPLORE AND SHARE]</p>

<p>They explored many places excitedly and discovered many culture differences. The pictures were printed out and put on the wall to share. In this activity, pictures provided many learning opportunities:</p>

<pre><code>the pictures show interesting information and details  
the pictures generate questions  
the pictures have stories  
</code></pre>

<p>Natalie remind the students:</p>

<pre><code>Place making=build and construct while,  
place maker=every body make a part.   
Teachers are place maker.  
Forget place we forget how to make place.  
</code></pre>

<p>I think this [place based learning] was carefully selected for our students, because it help them to explore UBC, practice oral English and think about connections between people and places.</p>

<h3>Wednesday 19th Nov, School Visit</h3>

<p>let the children to be children</p>

<p>I wrote a post about <a href="http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2017/01/18/papep-norma-rose-point-school/">Norma Rose Point School</a>.</p>

<p>How Learning theories are different and alike?[fill tables]</p>

<h3>Thursday 19th Nov, Skits</h3>

<p>Task: In your group, you are to perform a short skit that illustrates an "image of schooling" drawn from your experience as either a primary, secondary, or post-secondary school student. The performance lasts 2 or 3 minutes.[ROLE PLAY]</p>

<p>How we can divide the groups?[TEACHER QUESTION]<br/>
Students' answers: by group numbers,by tables, by a game, pick card, color of clothes, by students' abilities and so on.</p>

<p>How much time do we need to prepare this skit?<br/>
Students' answers: 20 minutes; 30 minutes; 25 minutes.<br/>
Teacher: OK we choose the middle.<br/>
[Democratic the Classroom]</p>

<p>Teacher decides the activity but let students decide the time to prepare. To do so, students can have some ownership.</p>

<p>Go to the corridor and divide groups by taking off a shoe.[MAKE IT ANOTHER WAY]</p>

<pre><code>The only limit is your imagination.  
</code></pre>

<h3>Friday 20th NOV, TPI</h3>

<p>[check in]<br/>
Use check in to borrow students' ideas and questions as learning needs and learning opportunities.</p>

<p>[music as alarm]<br/>
When it is time for rest, turn on the music. When class begin, turn it off and student aware of that without a pain.</p>

<p>Group dividing strategies:<br/>
[Number the table and symbol the students]<br/>
Let students pull out the table number[Democratic the Classroom] and teacher draw the symbol like a game. This strategy can engage more students. Don't' put back the table number if you don't want one table answer twice.</p>

<p>[verbal curing]<br/>
LET students know the signal 30 seconds ahead before you give the signal.</p>

<p>Other cures:</p>

<pre><code>verbal cure  
eye contact  
visual sight  
audio sound  
</code></pre>

<p><a href="http://www.teachingperspectives.com/tpi/">Teaching Perspectives Inventory</a><br/>
Students already took the survey and sent them to Tony. Tony print them out and sent it back to students. Then Tony began to count the heads who were dominant in one perspective and write the results on board. Then he let one student read the text about one perspective and then everyone try to summary the paragraph by keywords or phrase.<br/>
Here is the result:</p>

<pre><code>TRANSMISSION 1  
    accuracy Anthony content knowledge
APPRENTICESHIP 7  
    skill norm practice
DEVELOPMENTAL 4  
    learner reasoning and thinking,make sense of something
NURTURING 23  
    safety heart support 
SOCIAL REFORM 3  
    change collective, deconstruction, who why interests
</code></pre>

<p>Tony let student write on a note what impress them most these days. Then let them post it up on the wall near their pictures.[MAKE A PLACE FOR STUDENTS to share]</p>

<p>Let us get back to the question that I asked. My best answer for now is that Tony made good social and emotional connections with our students by making a place where they feel good by his hands, heart and minds. It was not tricks at all!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today Tony asked our students to make up a skit to show their image of schooling. This activity provide opportunities for students to speak English and express their ideas or images of schooling which may be the first step to realize and change their own teaching perspective.</p>

<p>During the activities, an interesting phenomenon showed up. Most of them criticized the education they had in China. While,it was true that the Chinese education had many problems. But, the thinking and reasoning of the problematic educational phenomenon is shallow, or not deep enough, in other word, critical thinking is missing.</p>

<p>In order to get more from this activity, students should not jump up to conclusion too quickly. They should not ignore the context that these things took place, the social context, the historical context, the economic context, the physical context, and so on. They should also rethink the theories and rationals behind their judgement and carefully examine the proof and logic. In short, critical thinking should take the place of criticism.</p>

<p>Why harsh criticism of people's own education is not good even harmful? First, it easily leads to extreme and skin deep thinking which block more intellectual endeavor. Second, it hurt their self-image and self-confidence. Third, it can easily separate their connection with the previous themselves and places. Extreme criticisms call abandon or escape but not improvement and responsibility. Try to think of place-based learning, it heals the disconnection between people and places while harsh criticism do the opposite.</p>

<p>According to Daniel T. Willingham, critical thinking have three key features: effectiveness, novelty, and self-direction. Critical thinking is effective in that it avoids common pitfalls, such as seeing only one side of an issue, discounting new evidence that disconfirms your ideas, reasoning from passion rather than logic, failing to support statemnts with evidence, and so on.</p>

<p>Critical thinking is novel in that you don't simply remember a solution or a situation that is similar enough to guide you. Using a complex algorithm to solve a math problem is not critical thinking. But devising a new algorithm is. Critical thinking is self-directed in that the thinker must be calling the shot(making desicions themselves): awards or punishment will disrupt instead of promote critical thinking.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have been in BC for 3days. Everything is new for our ECNU students, the beautiful campus of UBC, the long NO 44 bus, the comfortable Landmark hotel, the nice professors and staffs, the exciting learning activities.</p>

<p>Today is even special. We went to visit a middle school called <a href="http://go.vsb.bc.ca/schools/normarosepoint/Pages/default.aspx">Norma Rose Point School</a>. The school is not far from UBC, in fact it is the neighborhood of UBC. It took us about 20 or 30 minutes to walk there from Scarfe building where our classroom located. There are about six hundreds of students in the school, from kindergarten to grade 8, including both elementary and secondary education. This school is very unique because of its educational rationals and teaching building design.<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/ROSE_Point_school.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>They believe learning should be integrated and take place in communities instead of separated and in classrooms of each discipline. They want to give student a whole picture of the world and want them to experience this by themselves in their learning communities. In this way, students get better understanding of who they are, where they come form, how they will change the world around them. They will also take more responsibility of their learning and be proactive to inquiry the world around them rather listen to the teacher and memorize for tests.<br/>

<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/Community_learning_outcome.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The learning schedule and activities are designed and carried out by a faculty team but not a single teacher as traditionally school usually do. The teacher love this kind of collaborative teaching, it also give teacher many opportunities to learn from each others. It is much easier for new teacher to join the team to teach together. As you can see, they value collaboration very much. Student collaborate with student, teachers and even parents. Teacher collaborate with colleges, parents, and university professors. Student who are good at something can teach others. Teacher can do the same thing. They are all super heroes at that time. Super hero is a learning activity designed by the 4th grade teacher team which engage students and let them rethink what a hero means.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/grade4_learning_schedual.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Many features of the school building reflect educational wisdom. They make a window to let student who play basketball to look downstairs and notice what is happening in the football playground. All the classrooms are open without a door but only three or two walls. It means guests are always welcome to join or observe the class. There are also lots of art crafts made by student to show their understanding of their school spirits.<br/>

<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/open_classroom.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>It is hard to believe such an ideal school can exist and survive. ARE there any disadvantages and challenges for this kind of school? Of course there are, but who can deny their bold spirit and unique learning place design. It is beautiful! That is enough for now!</p>
