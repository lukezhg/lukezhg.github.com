    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2015/04/13/nos-and-pck-and-ck</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday(04,02,2015) I attend NARST 2015 session#3 stand 4(Science teaching--Middle and high school Grade 5-12) and strand 8 (The handbook of research on science education: implications for inservice teacher education) and strand 13 (History, Philosophy, and Sociology of science). In summary, it was all about PCK, PK and NoS.</p>

<p>There are two lines of questions to address:<br/>
What is the difference between PK and PCK? What is PK? Is there any Pedagogy content free? What is knowledge?<br/>
There are always content for teaching, right? You can not teaching nothing, can you? But of course, you can teach anything. You can also teach teaching, even at this time, you still need something as your teaching object in you examples or as your context. Sometimes we cannot think clearly about PK and PCK, because we do not make our view of knowledge clear. I will argue that Knowledge need to have some function for a population to exist and pass on from generation to generation. CK is about how the world works. Some people need to understand science. Some need to be able to do science. Some people apply science to improve living level. While, PK, in the context of science education, is all about how teacher help students learn science, how teaching works. It help teachers understand the what is teaching, how to teach better, why some strategies work while some not. Just like package, teacher need to know what content is inside? How is this content different from others? and which package suit for this content? How to make the package? how does this package work? how does it bridge the content and the students. How students approach this package? Did we use the right package in the right way?</p>

<p>Why NoS? Why NoS teaching fail? Why researchers suggest to use explicit way to teach NoS? What do you mean by explict?<br/>
We don't select to teach NoS simply for more and more researchers ask to do so. We do teach NoS because it has value for student to understant science, do science and apply science. Sometimes, we expect that students can learn NoS by themselves through science practices. But it is wrong. Researchers found that it is hard for students grasp NoS themselves. In this case, teachers should teach NoS purposely. They should design their lesson with NoS in mind and get students there intentionally. The explict way of teaching NoS, is not just tell the student what science is, but guide students' attention to it. It is not give students a bird, but show them where the bird located. For example, give student a bird locked in a cage help students feel and see where the bird is. But do we need improve their bird seeking skills? or do we just care the have the bird. To address this questions another way, Which is more important? To discover NoS through science practise or just understand NoS which reflect a better image of science(the image that science education reseachers and scientist captured). The answer is both are valuable learning outcomes. The process and the result both matter.</p>

<p>Don't put the car in front of the house.</p>

<p>Pay attention to the details.</p>

<p>Fit or not?<br/>
English writing?<br/>
Major fake?<br/>
Blind</p>

<p>You may change or you may refuse to change, but you have to respond to not buy very requests.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Sawyer, R. (2006). The Cambridge handbook of the learning sciences. (R. K. Sawyer, Ed.). Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511816833</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/Mscare.png" alt="Cognitive Apprenticeship" /></p>

<p>Method(Mscare):<br/>
Ways to promote the development of expertise<br/>
*  Modeling: teacher performs a task so students can observe<br/>
*  Scaffolding: teacher provides supports to help the student perform a task<br/>
*  Coaching: teacher observes and facilitates while students perform a task<br/>
*  Articulation: teacher encourages students to verbalize their knowledge and thinking<br/>
*  Reflection: teacher enables students to compare their performance with others<br/>
*  Exploration: teacher invites students to pose and solve their own problems</p>

<p>认知性学徒机制在网络社区甚至大学的学习实践中非常值得关注。在学习活动设计时，也应该遵循和利用上图所提到的步骤和原则。</p>

<p>比如这个表格所提到的内容、方法、次序和社区，在学习活动设计的时候就可以好好加以参照。</p>

<p>例如对于教学设计的学习：<br/>
一、内容<br/>
专业知识：前端分析（学习内容、学习者、学习需要）、教学目标设定和表述、设计教学思路和过程落实重难点、学习成果的评价设计、在具体教学情境下实施并优化。<br/>
一般性学习策略： 阅读材料、观察教学录像、见习、与专家教师交流、与同学相互交流、尝试设计和实施教学活动、自我反思。<br/>
控制策略：制定学习目标和学习计划、记录学习进度、提前准备、主动参与、主动寻求帮助、反思和总结、树立更有挑战的学习目标、掌控时间。<br/>
学习方法：通过反复强化练习口语以心理素质、通过优秀设计和教学视频找到自己的短板并模仿和创新、通过与专家教师的交流了解教学设计背后的思考和专家教师的思考和工作模式、通过微格训练锻炼基本的教学技能、通过阅读文献了解学生前科学概念研究成果、通过网络搜索查找教学素材和科学史内容。</p>

<p>二、方法<br/>
教师演示或者观看专家教师课堂录像<br/>
作为助教与一线教师共同授课或者分析课后作业<br/>
教师对师范生的学习活动组织的具体环节和过程进行校正和点评<br/>
指导老师帮助师范生理清自己的教学思路、活动和活动意图<br/>
鼓励师范生与其他师范生或者指导老师的教学做比较（目标、课堂气氛、教学技巧、学习效果等）<br/>
指导教师鼓励师范生思考和解决自己教学中遇到的问题</p>

<p>三、次序<br/>
教学设计任务应该：<br/>
由简单到复杂（观看视频、分析教学线索和设计意图、了解学生、分析内容、设计和表述教学目标、设计思路、收集素材、设计过程、学习效果评价的设计、评课、设计完整的一堂课、说课）<br/>
由一般情境到多种情境（初中、高中；农村、城市；普通、重点；传统、创新）<br/>
由总体概括到具体任务</p>

<p>四、社区<br/>
实际到中学去，看一看、相一想、试一试<br/>
建立网络分享、互助、活动学习社区<br/>
建立与一线教师和专家教师的专业对话<br/>
建立见习、实习的基地和教学训练的小组活动常规<br/>
激励内部动机，向着专家教师努力<br/>
学会集体合作、树立并完成更有挑战性的目标</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When My one-year long study life in US ended, I took a 10-days trip with my wife before returning to China. It was a impressive trip with both beautiful view and hardships on the road. I dislike surficial tours that can not let me understand more about the local people and culture. In this sense, the trip was worth the money, time and all the efforts.</p>

<p>We traveled mainly by taking Megabus, as college students or poor people did. We had lots of luggage, I know that we might get in trouble when taking buses, but I thought it would not be a big problem because I planned to pay more for the extra luggage. Everything wend very well before entering the Magebus. The city bus driver, a kind old black man, helped us pull the luggage. When I tried to give him tips, he denied. He said he helped us because he love Chinese and help us from heart not for money. He gave us a kindly smile and went back to his bus.</p>

<p>We arrived very early, so we had to wait for the megabus to arrive. It was our first time to take this kind of bus. At 3:40 PM, the megabus arrived. The driver was also a black man, but he was strong and a little fat. My wife stood most near the bus, but the drive said she was not standing in the queue, and let her to go back. We followed his directions, when it came to our turn he said you got too many luggage so you could not get on the bus. I said I could pay for the extra luggage. He said no no no. You could not pay me anything and ordered us to stand at the end of the queue.</p>

<p>After all the other passengers got on the bus, he told me that I could buy an extra ticket for the extra luggage but have to finish it in only 3 minutes. I became worried and nervous and a little angry. I worried that I couldn't catch the other magabus. I was a little angry because he already saw us with extra luggage 20 minutes before but only told us what to do when the bus was going to leave in 3 minutes. Another ridiculous thing he did was counting down when I was trying to call the company to buy an extra ticket. He was doing his job, but by no means trying to help. He seems want to bring shame on us on purpose just because we are Asian foreigners and bring two extra luggage.</p>

<p>After nearly 10 minutes, he seem enjoyed enough of the show he made, he let me get in the bus but never ask about the extra ticket. He seemed not care about the tickets at all. He did give some sarcastic remarks on this issue in his native English with black people's accent. All he said was how stickily he was following the rules of the company and it was all my fault that the bus was delayed. He let me sat on the steps beside him first and then separated me from my wife by asking me go upstairs(my wife sat at the first floor). First I went upstairs following his directions and then returned to the first floor by another ladders in the bus. My mood was terrible. My whole body was depressed and shaking. What kind of driver he was? I don't know. I also can't understand.</p>

<p>The trip had to be continued. By any means, it was not a good start.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is alway a lot more to learn. Athough I have been studying in UGA for 12 months, I still want to stay longer and learn more here. I like the beautiful campus and quiet main library, I also enjoy professors' classes and my classmates. Yes, I had a lot of fun here. But it is the time to say goodbye now.</p>

<p>After ten years, I think I will still remember the trees,the people, and the stories.<br/>
