<p>On a grassy lawn near the road, standed a little girl about five years old. She was looking up at the colorful tree leaves and jumping to reach them. She jumped up using all her energy but found herself still get nothing.</p>

<p>I walked close to the girl-she was really a beautiful angel.</p>

<p>"Do you need help?" I asked.<br/>
She stared at me with her shinning black eyes without saying a word.<br/>
"Do you want some leaves? I can help!" I repeated. <br/>
"No" she answered. <br/>
"I can use the ball." She fetched a ball from the ground just several steps away.<br/>
"then the leaves will fall."<br/>
"You are very clever!" I said.<br/>
After I left, she began throw the ball up to the leaves again and again - very exitedly.</p>

<p>Well, she may never heared of the term "gravity", but she do have been aware of it and even make use of it to get the beautiful leaves.</p>

    <updated>2013-09-27T11:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/27/reflection-on-groupwork-modeling</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have wrote several posts about modeling:<br/>
Such as <a href="/blog/2013/08/24/interaction-simulation-based-inquiry-activities/">Interactive simulation based inquiry activities</a><br/>
Look for more click <a href="/tag/modeling/">here</a></p>

<p>But this time I would rather to think modeling from the groupwork perspective.</p>

<p>As a teacher, we should keep in mind that groupwork can only be flowers while big science ideas are the real fruits. The big flowers don't guaranteed the fruits are big.</p>

<p>Groupwork tasks take times, so they must be well designed and organized.</p>

<p>What do I mean by well designed? The groupwork should meet the following preconditions:<br/>
1.  It is highly realated with the science idea that student are going to learn.<br/>
2.  It is challenging enough that it can't be done individually.<br/>
3.  It is reachable for students with their present knowledges and skills.<br/>
4.  It generates meaningful discussions and productive outcommings.</p>

<p>What do I mean by well organized? The teacher should do the following:<br/>
1.  Students' prior idea should be explored and addressed.<br/>
2.  Possiblely related science theories or ideas should be put on the table(eg by brainstorming).<br/>
3.  All group members should engaged actively and equally in the task.<br/>
4.  Students can learn to communicate and collaborate like scientists.<br/>
5.  Competition can be used to save time and for fun.</p>

<p>How to help students to generate more productive group conversation?<br/>
1.  State proper questions or the tasks clearly. Everyone knows what to do.<br/>
2.  Use deep silent thinking and wide brainstorm, Enage what students prior ideas and concepts to expain the data/phenomenon? Everyone needs to participate in group conversation in some way.<br/>
3.  Visualize group ideas or models with tools and posters.<br/>
4.  Test and Review the models critically and make suggestions.<br/>
5.  Revise the models in light of new data and feedbacks from class community.</p>

    <updated>2013-09-24T22:30:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/09/24/japan-lesson-study</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I watched two vedios of Japan science teaching see my <a href="/blog/2013/08/19/timss-video-and-reflection-of-teaching-science-with-modeling/">previous post</a></p>

<p>Since then I tend to pay close attention to Japan science education including both teaching practice and teacher professional development. Tonight we talked about the lesson study in Japan and China, So googled Japan lesson study and found 2 interesting resources(attached at the end of this post).</p>

<p>I think the Japan lesson study sounds really good.</p>

<p>First, the lesson is designed and prepared by a team not a single teacher. This is different from China, where one teacher is reponsible for everything and under a great pressure. When a team prepare and co-design the lesson, teacher can really have more opportunities to learn from each other.</p>

<p>Second, the study is aiming to solve a problem or acheiving a special goal. It is not providing a common good lesson for other teachers to follow or comment. This goal-orantied study will make it more meaningful for teachers. It becomes easier for other teachers take a stand to think if they have acheived their goal or what would help.</p>

<p>Third, the team will spend 3-4 years on the same goal, they will design a long range plan to achieve it. They also refine their goal ever year. So it tend to be a continue systematic problem solving process with significant value in a special school context.</p>

<p>Fourth, the topics of discussion and reflection can cover a wide range of concerns, including content related issues(goal of unit and lesson, concepts, problem to focus on, students' solution and response), and pedagogical issues and behaviors issues, also education rationals and goals.</p>
