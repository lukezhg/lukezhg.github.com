    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The National Association for Research in Science Teaching (NARST) is a worldwide organization of professionals committed to the improvement of science teaching and learning through research. More about NARST click <a href="https://www.narst.org/about/mission.cfm">here</a>.</p>

<p>The 2014 Annual meeting is hold in Pittsburgh from March 30 to April 2. The theme of this meeting is "AWAKENING DIALOGUES — Advancing Science Education Research Practices and Policies". I attended this conference and presented a paper with my advisor. There were more than one thousand of participants from more than 25 countries. And many many presentations and posters were going on at the same time. Fortunately I bought the conference program book which contain maps and all related information. Although I did take my laptop with me, but actually I found that the book helped me a lot especially on finding a place and planing for where to go in order to listen to special presentations.</p>

<p>There were 13 sessions in total. I attended 10 sessions and plus 1 session in which I presented our study on teacher perception. I arrived at Sunday afternoon and missed 2 sessions. But after that, I managed to took all the left sessions. So you can imagine how busy I was at that time when going from one room to another room. I thought we could not attend the committee meeting but in fact Dr Jackson told me we were allowed to do that as long as we were interested. Next time I would like to have a try. It was really a pity that I forgot to take a picture with my advisor. In fact I just took a lot of pictures of other researchers' slides but did not take any picture of myself. Instead, my advisor took some pictures for me when I was introducing our study. During the last session, a presenter asked the audiences(only 3 people including me because most had left) to took a picture with her. This was the only picture that I took with others in my first NARST conferences. Next time I don't want such a harry anymore. I will try to take my time to enjoy the next conference rather than keep running all the time.</p>

    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2014/01/25/science-bowl</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is an amazing day. I volunteered to be a score keeper in the Science Bowl in UGA. It is a competition of science questions for high school students like the game of Jeopardy. There are two types of question: buzz-in question and bonus question. Every player in both team can buzz-in and give the answer, if the answer is correct then they got 4 points and got a bonus question for their team, they can discuss the question together and answer it, if correct they got another 10 points, if wrong no points. I attended a training session for volunteers to be a score keeper. I am kind of exited because I don't know what would it be going like.</p>

<p>But in the Morning when I got up at 7:00, I began to worried about the bus. Today is Saturday and the UGA bus would not run so early. I promised to be there before 8 am. So I went to the city bus stop to check if the city bus can take me there on time. Unfortunately the first No 5 bus will be at 8:20. What should I do? I realize the incontinence of not having a car. I ran to the next stop where both the UGA bus and the city bus stop, hoping the UGA bus can come. But when it is 7:20, no bus come. I became helpless. A crazy idea came to my mind. Why not run there. So I began to ran with my laptop in my backpack. Usually it will took me 30 minutes to  Aderhold by bus. But I just had 40 minutes. I did not think I could make it. But I really don't want to be late because the score form is still in my driver, to make sure everything goes well with the competition I have to make it. It was also my first time to run alone by myself to Aderhold. At first, I felt cold because of the wind, later my back got so warm that I began to sweat. The road is hilly. When I was climbing uphill, I was nearly out of breadth. The police car passed me several times, very few people on the road this early morning. They might thought this guy was kind of strange, he ran on the road but with a heavy backpack. I did not quiet understand myself either, why I brought my computer with me. It is just a habit. A brave idea hit me several times: Can I ask the police for a ride. It would be wise and abrupt. At about 7:50, I saw Georgia center, I could not believe myself. It just took 30 minutes to get there. I regained my confidence to get there on time. I start ran more quickly. Finally I arrived at Aderhold at 7:58. It is amazing, isn't it?</p>

<p>I am kind of curious what drive me forward and finally make it at several times that I nearly gave up? No matter what it is, it is powerful. And if you have this power, nothing is impossible.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education (Chickering &amp; Gamson, 1987):<br/>
1. Good practice encourages interaction between students and faculty.<br/>
2. Good practice encourages interaction and collaboration between students.<br/>
3. Good practice uses active learning techniques.<br/>
4. Good practice gives prompt feedback.<br/>
5. Good practice emphasizes time on task.<br/>
6. Good practice communicates high expectations.<br/>
7. Good practice respects diversity—talents, experience, and ways of learning.</p>

<p>Seven Learner-Centered Principles to Improve Teaching (Ambrose et al., 2010):<br/>
1. Students’ prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.<br/>
2. How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.<br/>
3. Students’ motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to learn.<br/>
4. To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned.<br/>
5. Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students’ learning.<br/>
6. Students’ current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning.<br/>
7. To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.</p>

<p>Principles based on brain science(Zull, 2002):<br/>
1. recognize the importance of emotion.<br/>
2. help students feel in control.<br/>
3. build on existing neuronal networks (prior knowledge), even if these networks are wrong.</p>
