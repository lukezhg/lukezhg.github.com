    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today is an amazing day. I volunteered to be a score keeper in the Science Bowl in UGA. It is a competition of science questions for high school students like the game of Jeopardy. There are two types of question: buzz-in question and bonus question. Every player in both team can buzz-in and give the answer, if the answer is correct then they got 4 points and got a bonus question for their team, they can discuss the question together and answer it, if correct they got another 10 points, if wrong no points. I attended a training session for volunteers to be a score keeper. I am kind of exited because I don't know what would it be going like.</p>

<p>But in the Morning when I got up at 7:00, I began to worried about the bus. Today is Saturday and the UGA bus would not run so early. I promised to be there before 8 am. So I went to the city bus stop to check if the city bus can take me there on time. Unfortunately the first No 5 bus will be at 8:20. What should I do? I realize the incontinence of not having a car. I ran to the next stop where both the UGA bus and the city bus stop, hoping the UGA bus can come. But when it is 7:20, no bus come. I became helpless. A crazy idea came to my mind. Why not run there. So I began to ran with my laptop in my backpack. Usually it will took me 30 minutes to  Aderhold by bus. But I just had 40 minutes. I did not think I could make it. But I really don't want to be late because the score form is still in my driver, to make sure everything goes well with the competition I have to make it. It was also my first time to run alone by myself to Aderhold. At first, I felt cold because of the wind, later my back got so warm that I began to sweat. The road is hilly. When I was climbing uphill, I was nearly out of breadth. The police car passed me several times, very few people on the road this early morning. They might thought this guy was kind of strange, he ran on the road but with a heavy backpack. I did not quiet understand myself either, why I brought my computer with me. It is just a habit. A brave idea hit me several times: Can I ask the police for a ride. It would be wise and abrupt. At about 7:50, I saw Georgia center, I could not believe myself. It just took 30 minutes to get there. I regained my confidence to get there on time. I start ran more quickly. Finally I arrived at Aderhold at 7:58. It is amazing, isn't it?</p>

<p>I am kind of curious what drive me forward and finally make it at several times that I nearly gave up? No matter what it is, it is powerful. And if you have this power, nothing is impossible.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Seven Principles for Good Practice in Undergraduate Education (Chickering &amp; Gamson, 1987):<br/>
1. Good practice encourages interaction between students and faculty.<br/>
2. Good practice encourages interaction and collaboration between students.<br/>
3. Good practice uses active learning techniques.<br/>
4. Good practice gives prompt feedback.<br/>
5. Good practice emphasizes time on task.<br/>
6. Good practice communicates high expectations.<br/>
7. Good practice respects diversity—talents, experience, and ways of learning.</p>

<p>Seven Learner-Centered Principles to Improve Teaching (Ambrose et al., 2010):<br/>
1. Students’ prior knowledge can help or hinder learning.<br/>
2. How students organize knowledge influences how they learn and apply what they know.<br/>
3. Students’ motivation determines, directs, and sustains what they do to learn.<br/>
4. To develop mastery, students must acquire component skills, practice integrating them, and know when to apply what they have learned.<br/>
5. Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback enhances the quality of students’ learning.<br/>
6. Students’ current level of development interacts with the social, emotional, and intellectual climate of the course to impact learning.<br/>
7. To become self-directed learners, students must learn to monitor and adjust their approaches to learning.</p>

<p>Principles based on brain science(Zull, 2002):<br/>
1. recognize the importance of emotion.<br/>
2. help students feel in control.<br/>
3. build on existing neuronal networks (prior knowledge), even if these networks are wrong.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I saw this in our main library when the staff cleanup the restroom.<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/door-with-leg.png" alt="Door with leg" /><br/>
What a cool leg the door has! The idea is simple, but the result is so good. Sometimes simple change can make a big difference.</p>

<p>Nowadays, the environment is becoming worse and worse. One basic reason is bad design. Our company design good batteries with low-cost but ignored how to recycle and reuse the waste batteries. Similarly, the white pollution, air and water pollution all failded to take environment pollution cost into concern. These industries are all good examples of bad design and are badly need to change.</p>

<p>Well, how to solve these problems and create better future? The answer is design zero pollution industry pipeline. Just like the nature design all kinds of lives, no waste at all. For example, how to make use of clean energy as power for travelling. When you taking whole process into concern, you will find the horse and cart is one example of good designs. Of course, we will not return to this old method of travelling, but we really should rethink this design.</p>

<p>It is not just product design or pipeline design. It is also a life design. On behavior researcher found a very simple and effective way to save energy-- sending a letter of electric usage report comparing with neighborhood. After being told use more than twice electric than neighborhood, people tend to pay much attention to save energy. This is just how behavior science used to affect personal life styles.</p>

<p>Nowadays, people have learnt to make use clean energy such as wind, water,sun. Researchers are also trying to invent new technologies of producing and storing and converting these energy. We are going to and have to achieve no waste design in order to live a better life for long run on earth.</p>

<p>Only man can make products that can not be reused by other species; Plastic bottles are among these products. And most of the pollution industries keep running in developing countries cause the pollution standards are lower and the poor people need work to feed their families. But the pollution will destroy their land first and then the planet follows. No matter for the purpose of helping them or keeping ourselves safe, we all should do something to stop this, stop the throwaway economy.</p>

<p>One way is making zero pollution. Don't develop new pollution industries. Help and supervise our industries to achieve zero pollution.</p>

<p>Second, we should take measures to handle with our present pollution problems. Both the government and education should play a role. We are going to make our daily live zero pollution.</p>

<p>Third, all the countries on the world should collaborate. Many big challenges already laid in front of us. If we can not communicate and collaborate well, then the future of our earth is dim.</p>

<p>What are we throwing away? The plastic bottles? The seas of plastic? The living space and resources for next generations? Or our conscience as a human being and a member on earth?</p>
