    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Writing is an very important skill as speaking. It aims to send message, from generation to generation, from people to people, from country to country. One of the most effienct way to do this is publishing in good journals. Nowadays, publication has become a crucial part of resume or CV, and people write paper not just for sending message by also seeking for fame and honor. So good universitis ask faculties for good papers; good researchers look for good journals. Good journals want good impators or indexs. Reseachers like to cite papers from good journals. It would be good if this system can really help sending necessary message to people with various needs. But we should keep in mind that it may not necessarily be the case. It is just a number game.</p>

<p>Complain is enough. We still have to write. But I believe we are writing for our audiences not for universitis and journal companies. We write because we have the impluse to share. As a begining researcher and writer, I'd like to co-write with others at first. It helps me learn writing faster and have meaningful conversations with other people. So I would also recommand others doing it this way.</p>

<p>Athough you may not like the game, it is still good to know the rules and some tools. Here are some useful resources for writhing educational journals:</p>

<h3>Writing tools and tips:</h3>

<p>[Google Drive] can help you co-write online.<br/>
[Mendeley] can help you manage your references.<br/>
[HisCite] can make graph to let you know how paper cited each other.<br/>
[SPSS] can help you analyze the data.<br/>
<a href="http://latex-project.org/intro.html">LaTeX</a> is a good document preparation system especially useful when you have lots of equations and graphs(generated with R).<br/>
There are lots of other text editors such as Miscro-soft Word, EditPlus for consider.</p>

<h3>Useful books for formating:</h3>

<p>[Publication Menual by APA]<br/>
<a href="http://www.apastyle.org/">APA Style website</a><br/>
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/0060891548">On Writing Well</a> by Zinsser</p>

<p>I lost myself sometimes in some very narrow area. People may ignore the whole when they are attracted and trapped by them. It can be power, It can be sex, It can also be anger and violence.</p>

<p>A picture comes to my mind when I am thinking of these dangerous Local Extrema---the local extrema. I frist notice this phenomenion in NG's machine learning class. This is the picture that he used to show local extrema. <br/>

<p>When the computer only have one seed, it is very likely trapped in a local extrema and return a wrong answer. It is just like a person who lost himself when he try to reach the extrema unrealized that it is only the local extrema.</p>

<p>Citizen Science<br/>
Citizen science (also known as crowd science, crowd-sourced science, civic science, or networked science) is scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur or nonprofessional scientists, often by crowdsourcing and crowdfunding. Formally, citizen science has been defined as "the systematic collection and analysis of data; development of technology; testing of natural phenomena; and the dissemination of these activities by researchers on a primarily avocational basis".[1] Citizen science is sometimes called "public participation in scientific research."[2]<br/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The National Association for Research in Science Teaching (NARST) is a worldwide organization of professionals committed to the improvement of science teaching and learning through research. More about NARST click <a href="https://www.narst.org/about/mission.cfm">here</a>.</p>

<p>The 2014 Annual meeting is hold in Pittsburgh from March 30 to April 2. The theme of this meeting is "AWAKENING DIALOGUES — Advancing Science Education Research Practices and Policies". I attended this conference and presented a paper with my advisor. There were more than one thousand of participants from more than 25 countries. And many many presentations and posters were going on at the same time. Fortunately I bought the conference program book which contain maps and all related information. Although I did take my laptop with me, but actually I found that the book helped me a lot especially on finding a place and planing for where to go in order to listen to special presentations.</p>

<p>There were 13 sessions in total. I attended 10 sessions and plus 1 session in which I presented our study on teacher perception. I arrived at Sunday afternoon and missed 2 sessions. But after that, I managed to took all the left sessions. So you can imagine how busy I was at that time when going from one room to another room. I thought we could not attend the committee meeting but in fact Dr Jackson told me we were allowed to do that as long as we were interested. Next time I would like to have a try. It was really a pity that I forgot to take a picture with my advisor. In fact I just took a lot of pictures of other researchers' slides but did not take any picture of myself. Instead, my advisor took some pictures for me when I was introducing our study. During the last session, a presenter asked the audiences(only 3 people including me because most had left) to took a picture with her. This was the only picture that I took with others in my first NARST conferences. Next time I don't want such a harry anymore. I will try to take my time to enjoy the next conference rather than keep running all the time.</p>
