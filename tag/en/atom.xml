    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, a TED talk at TEDxStanford moved me deeply. It was given by Rhodes Scholar Rachel Kolb -- who was born deaf. She showed what is possible through family support and self-belief, and proves that what is assumed about you and what you can actually achieve don't always match up. In the United States, two-thirds of hearing-impaired people do not complete high school.</p>

<p>When I attended a coteaching workshop, an American teacher asked me if there were any disabled students in Chinese schools. I said very few. In my experiences, from elementary school to high school, even in university, I had never meet a disabled students, who was deaf or blind. Where are they? They do exist, but may live alienated lives out of our eyes.</p>

<p>In UGA, I saw many students sitting on their wheelchairs in streets, classroom, libraries, even on buses. They really provide good access for disabled.</p>

<p>In China, the situation in Beijing and Shanghai may be better than other cities. But we still hardly see disabled people appear in front us, when they do appear, they usually have many accompanies who help them to overcome the unexpected obstacles posed by people unconsciously.</p>

<p>Disabled people do deserve to live a normal life. Please don't alienate them!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It is so hard to descibe how teacher develop related knowledge to teach a special topic.</p>

<p>I have come up with many analogies to assit my thinking and modeling of teacher knowledge development.</p>

<p>Here is another wonderful analogy Rock Climbing. The following is a picture:<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/rock-climbing.png" alt="rock climbing" /><br/>
More about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_climbing#Crack_climbing">Rock climbing</a><br/>
The teacher developed lots of intermediate representations (just like the cracks, faces, slabs in rock climbing) to help students learning the scientific concept.</p>

<p>Good teacher can "see" the postions of students and can "arise" the right representation to help. The subject matter knowledge is the moutain. The "safety rope" is the good teacher-student relationship which keep the safe environment for learning. The routes can be fun and the goal can be challenging. They all motivates student to climb and learn.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I attened the Science Method class. An interesting question discussed was the experiment of falling objects-the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo%27s_Leaning_Tower_of_Pisa_experiment">Galileo's Leaning Tower of Pisa experiment</a>.  Dr. Luft provided us some students' responses and let us to figure out the students' thinking and how to response to students properly.</p>

<p>But the question caught my curiosity in the class was two ice cube droping from the same inclination.<br/>

<p>I asked my classmates what happens in the following situations.<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/3inclinations.png" alt="picture" /></p>

<p>I acturally did the experiment using <a href="http://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/energy-skate-park">simulation environment</a>.</p>

<p>The result is interesting. Ball B frist arrived at the bottom with lest time.(The first two curves are situation A; Next two curves are situation B)
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/skater.png" alt="Result" /></p>

<p>Ball A is the second arrived. Ball C is the last one. <br/>
From Leaning Tower of Pisa Experiment to simulated experiment, what a big change information technology has made to our science teaching and learning!</p>

<p>In fact, David Scott-Astronaut of  Apollo 15-recreated Galileo's famous experiment on the Moon by Hammer and Feather Drop.</p>

<p>You see the space technology also expanded our learning experience and provided us an amazing teaching resource-a dicrepant event.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/autumn-tree.jpg" alt="autumn-tree.jpg" /></p>

<p>On a grassy lawn near the road, standed a little girl about five years old. She was looking up at the colorful tree leaves and jumping to reach them. She jumped up using all her energy but found herself still get nothing.</p>

<p>I walked close to the girl-she was really a beautiful angel.</p>

<p>"Do you need help?" I asked.<br/>
She stared at me with her shinning black eyes without saying a word.<br/>
"Do you want some leaves? I can help!" I repeated. <br/>
"No" she answered. <br/>
"I can use the ball." She fetched a ball from the ground just several steps away.<br/>
"then the leaves will fall."<br/>
"You are very clever!" I said.<br/>
After I left, she began throw the ball up to the leaves again and again - very exitedly.</p>

<p>Well, she may never heared of the term "gravity", but she do have been aware of it and even make use of it to get the beautiful leaves.</p>
