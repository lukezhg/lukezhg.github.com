    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>How to make supervision sustainable?</h3>

<p>==>Design and Develop a mutual benefit and win-win relationship between participants.<br/>
It is kind of like to do a jigsaw. First you have to see every piece very clearly and then you can make the best guess and try to connect the two pieces.</p>

<h3>Look into the pieces(participants):</h3>

<p>Supervisor<br/>
- typically are university professors(University)<br/>
- experienced in-service teachers(Middle School)<br/>
- principles(Middle School)</p>

<p>Supervisee<br/>
- new teacher(Middle School)<br/>
- student teacher(University)<br/>
- in-service teacher who want to make a change(Middle School)</p>

<p>Facilitators<br/>
- companies<br/>
- administrators(MS)
- Professors<br/>
- stuff(MS, U)
- reformers<br/>
- NGO<br/>
- Government</p>

<h3>Possible Groups(supervisor,supervisee,facilitators):</h3>

<p>Single Community:<br/>
(student teacher, student teacher, professor)<br/>
(in-service teacher, in-service teacher, adminstrator)
(Experienced teacher, new teacher, stuff)</p>

<p>Cross two communities:<br/>
(Professor,(in-service teacher, student teacher),stuff)<br/>
(Professor,in-service teacher, administrators)<br/>
(Professor,(in-service teacher &amp; student teacher),stuff)<br/>
(In-service teacher, student teacher, professor)<br/>
((Professor &amp; in-service teacher),(in-service teacher &amp; student teacher),Professor)</p>

<p>Cross three communities:<br/>
(Professor,(in-service teacher &amp; student teacher), company)<br/>
(Professor,(in-service teacher &amp; student teacher),NGO)<br/>
(Professor,in-service teacher, Government)<br/>
(Professor,in-service teacher, reformers)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Metaphors for teaching:</h3>

<p>A teacher is just like a cook. You can tell a good cook by the taste of his dishes, so you can also tell a good teacher by his students' acheivements. Sometimes you can also tell a good cook by observing his cooking process. Good cook can aways get everything ready quickly and easily. Good teacher do the same thing.</p>

<p>Teachers' job is adapting the curriculum and materials to local settings and particular learning goals. Effective teachers are aware of what they are currently doing, aways pursueing new effecive ways to teach the same content. It is just like cooks making foods for different customers.  <br/>

<p>
Teachers' content knowledge affect their abilities of transfroming the curriculum and materials to students in a special context to acheive a designed learning goal. It is the foundation of science teacher knowledge. If there is no good content knowledge, there is no good content to transform.</p>

<p>It is like the nutrition in the food, if the food contain no nutriton, the best cook can do nothing to help.</p>

<p>It is also like taxi driving. The taxi driver who knows the traffic system well, is possiblely able to figure out the most quick way to go for you at a special time and location. Content knowledge just provide more pathes to consider and follow. Otherwise, it is easy to get lost and embarrassed.

<h3>Metaphor for education reform:</h3>

<p>Sometimes science teacher educators complain that teachers' beliefs are stubborn and reluctant to change their practices. Well, It is true.</p>

<p>The teacher is like a swimmer in a river. <br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/teacher-is-swimmer.png" alt="teacher is swimmer" /></p>

<p>The science teacher educator stand on the river bank and tell the swimmer where to go, how to swim, which style is more effective than others. But the most important thing for a person in the river is to keep safty and the most reliable style is the style which he already got. How can we blame them not trying to change, if their safty is not guaranteed and new skills not developed.</p>

<p>As a science teacher educator, you can not always stand by but jump into the water and provide necessary skills and safety.</p>

<p>I had spent 5~10 hours per week on each course. In fact, I didn't expect to accomplished them and got certificates. They just appeared interesting and related with my work. So I tried my best to take the boat and take every advantages of  the learning oportunities and resources. But the statments of accomplishment do encourage me to take more similar courses, so they are powerful in this sense.</p>
