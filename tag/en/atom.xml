    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A strange thing happend when I was reading a book and counting how many columns in a table. To my suprise, the number I counted in English didn't equal to the number counted in Chinese. In English the number is nine, but in Chinese it is eight columns. Finallly I found I missed the number five when I was couting in English. What a big discovery!</p>

<p>I don't know why I tend to ignore the number five subconsciously. But there was a real story about the number five. At that time, I was still a college student. Jelle and Ineke, friends of my advisor visited Beijing. It was their first time to be in the city, so I showed them around to visit temples, parks and other spots. We mainly took bus to travel cause it was cheap and we would have chances to experience the Chinese daily lives. One day, we were waiting for No 5 bus. My spoken English was not proficient and often make mistakes expecially in pronunciation. I said to Jelle we were going to take No 5 bus(but I pronunced like "No file bus"). But he didn't understand. I repeated but still didn't make sense. Then after a while, he understood and said No five. He even taught me how to pronunce it correctly. But I was very ashame of that, and still found it difficult for me to pronunce FIVE.</p>

<p>According to Freud's Unconscious theory, people tend to ignore or hide the unpleseant experience, this would help to explain my error in English counting.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I finally find a swimming poor that I can have access in UGA. It is in the Remsey Center just take the next stop of Aderhold by East-West School Bus. I purchased a membership for three months($15 per month). Today I went there to work out and swim. It is really worth every cents.</p>

<p>I took several pictures:<br/>

I often see people running on the road to do exercise. Sometimes man, sometimes old men stripped to the waist, sometimes women with young boy or girls. In fact, the road in Athens are not flat, so they have to run up and down. They really got the admirable sport spirits.</p>

<p>
The following is a picture of the swimming pool taken from a window.  The water is blue and there many students swimming like fish in the water.<br/>

<p>Today the climbing wall is open for free. It will be one day for free per month. So if you want to try, don't miss the boat. <br/>

I am too tired after swimming to try it. May be next time.</p>

    <updated>2013-08-26T18:23:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2013/08/26/firefox-extension-firegesture-scripts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I found the firefox extension Firegesture is very useful. You can self-define the function of your gestures.</p>

<p>The following are my scripts:<br/>
1.  Sina Weibo(DUDU)<br/>
<code></p>

<pre><code>var sel = 'http://v.t.sina.com.cn/share/share.php?title='+encodeURIComponent(document.title)+'&amp;url='+encodeURIComponent(window.content.location.href)+'&amp;source=bookmark';
gBrowser.loadOneTab(sel, {
    inBackground: true,
    relatedToCurrent: true
});
</code></pre>

<p></code>
2. iciba(RLR)<br/>
<code></p>

<pre><code>var word = getBrowserSelection();
if (!word)
    return;
var sel = 'http://www.iciba.com/'+encodeURIComponent(word);
gBrowser.loadOneTab(sel, {
    inBackground: true,
    relatedToCurrent: true
});
</code></pre>

<p></code>
3.  Copy the title and url</p>

<pre><code>
const AS_HTML = false;

function htmlEscape(s) {
  s = s.replace(/&/g, "&amp;");
  s = s.replace(/>/g, "&gt;");
  s = s.replace(/</g, "&lt;");
  s = s.replace(/"/g, "&quot;");
  return s;
}
var url = window.content.location.href;
var title = window.content.document.title;
var txt = AS_HTML ? 
  '<a href="' + htmlEscape(url) + '">' + htmlEscape(title) + '</a>' : 
  title + "\n" + url;
var clipboard = Cc["@mozilla.org/widget/clipboardhelper;1"]
                .getService(Ci.nsIClipboardHelper);
clipboard.copyString(txt);
</code></pre>
