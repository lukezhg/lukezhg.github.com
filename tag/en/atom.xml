    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>21天的紧张学习，一次特别意义的春节，3次新奇而愉快校园之旅，在我们全员参与的一场快闪热舞之后落下帷幕。有<a href="https://v.qq.com/x/page/a0371cjogl2.html">视频</a>为证。</p>

<p><embed src="https://imgcache.qq.com/tencentvideo_v1/playerv3/TPout.swf?max_age=86400&v=20161117&vid=a0371cjogl2&auto=0" allowFullScreen="true" quality="high" width="480" height="400" align="middle" allowScriptAccess="always" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></p>

<p>这次培训项目是Tony老师为我们师范生精心准备和量身打造的、高质量的课程。当中 有很多教育理念、教学技巧、策略以及教学活动都值得未来教师教育项目参考和借鉴。</p>

<p>其中给我形象最为深刻的活动如下：<br/>
1、教育印象（image of schooling: An image about teaching or learning that has some meaning to you）<br/>
2、劈叉苦茶 Pechakucha Pairs(15seconds X20 pages) 开学第一天就明确最后作业<br/>
Planning Sheet for Pechakucha- peer review<br/>
3、在地性学习（place-based learning -- interviewing the campus）<br/>
4、读书进程 （Reading Schedule）<br/>
5、TPI survey<br/>
6、Multiple Intelligence survey<br/>
7、学习经历短剧（Skit that illustrates your experience as a student）<br/>
8、学校观察（New understanding and questions about teachers, students, subject matter, Milieux）<br/>
9、个体帮助（Meet with professor Marina Milner-Bolotin）<br/>
10、社会和情感学习能力（Self-awareness, Social awareness, Responsible decision-making, self-management, relationship skills）</p>

<h3>教育策略及其背后理念:</h3>

<p>可视化（教育是认知加工辅助）如画示意图<br/>
游戏化（教育是刺激反应连接）如开展比赛，教师团队和学生团队pk，4人讲同一主题，两两一组，同课异构，相互PK，一方做教师另外一方就做学生，另外4人担任裁判，做教学记录，并最终在支持的一方处签名。<br/>
民主化（教育是社会文化转型）如让学生决定准备时间，分权而不是控制<br/>
意义化（教育是意义主动构建）如参观学校主动构建对学校教育的理解</p>

<h3>具体的做法和技巧：</h3>

<p>Philosophy of teaching statement<br/>
short test<br/>
Fill the form sheet to draw your conclusion</p>

<h3>Group work</h3>

<p>1、Think-pair-share<br/>
2、Jigsaw<br/>
3、Three step interview(interview alternate and then share in group)<br/>
4、Group Investigation(找到共同兴趣点、计划研究内容、研究任务分工、分析、总结、报告)</p>

<p>divide into different groups by taking off a shoe</p>

<h3>Inquiry based activities</h3>

<p>1、Use factoid to provoke student questions(e.g.: Tornadoes are nearly invisible whirling winds until dust and debris are picked up or a cloud forms inside the funnel.)<br/>
2、Push student thinking by asking questions(What do you wonder about now? Does this suggest any new approaches, ideas to you worth investigating? what kinds of connections can you make? where do we go from here?)<br/>
3、Slow down<br/>
4、Be on the look out for student's questions and persistent interests<br/>
5、Use previous activities to move forward<br/>
6、Help students make sense of non-fiction text（by different symbols）</p>

<p>促进学生思考的策略：<br/>
分享教学目标、关键问题或面临的挑战<br/>
随机提问<br/>
Wait Time<br/>
澄清或转述学生的回答<br/>
追问（为什么？你同意吗？你能举个例子吗？）<br/>
让学生总结（你可以总结一下小丽的观点吗？）<br/>
克制价值判断性言论<br/>
让学生外化思维过程（你是怎么得出这个答案的？）<br/>
信息可视化（如图片组织者）</p>

<p>简单学习策略<br/>
时间伙伴（clock buddies）<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/clock_buddies.png" alt="clock buddiest" />
Think, Pair, Share(2分钟独立思考，2分钟同伴交流，最后班级分享)<br/>
图形组织者<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/graphic_organizer.png" alt="graphic organizert" /><br/>
PMI chart<br/>
<img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/PMI.png" alt="PMI chart" /></p>

<p>更复杂的学习策略<br/>
3 step interview（访谈者，被访谈者，报告员，3个主题的访谈，每一轮角色轮换一次）<br/>
角色扮演\skit（情景短剧）<br/>
拼图Jigsaw（每组派一名学生去专家组学习，然后返回学习小组进行分享）<br/>
Place Mat<br/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I was wandering around in Vancouver BC last month, I found a art gallery along the Howe Street by chance. It is called LeSoleil Fine Art Gallery.</p>

<p>It was raining and I had some time, so I decided to have a look inside of the gallery. One artist's painting named "That Night the Magic Mirror" attracted my attention. The artist's name is Cecilia Aisin-Gioro (爱新觉罗.恒钦). She is the grandniece of the last Chinese Emperor Pu Yi Aisin-Gioro.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.github.com/lukezhg/Freyja/master/that-night-the-magic-mirror.jpg" alt="That Night the Magic Mirror original" /></p>

<p>You can find more paintings of her <a href="http://lesoleilfineart.com/cecilia-aisin-gioro">here</a>.</p>

<p>At my first look of the picture, the woman is very beautiful and youthful, but herself in the mirror seems less energetic. When you look the picture carefully, you will found a mistake(or unnatural phenomenon) in the picture. Take your time to have a look.</p>

<p>The woman have two left arms, one you can see directly, one in the mirror, without right arm. What does Cecilia want to say? or it is just a mistake?</p>

<p>The other thing I don't like is the face in the mirror. It is flat and dull comparing with her real face.</p>

<p>So I changed it like this.<br/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Monday</h3>

<p>On Monday, we went to Victoria and visited the BC Museum. It took us about 2 hours to look around the natural history and human history exhibition. The most interesting things were Mammoth and indigenous people of Canada. Our students also had a great time on the ferry, because it was the first time for most of them to travel by ferry. I took us nearly one and a half hour to across the Channel. So most of our time was spent on road or boat.</p>

<h3>Tuesday</h3>

<p>On Tuesday, during the time of check in, one student asked about the religion system in Canada. Andrea hesitated whether should talk about this. Tony encouraged her to have a try and she gave use a useful introduction of the family trees and history of different religions in BC. Tony highlighted the idea of religious tolerance, which means people can respect and be tolerant to others' religions.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, a terrible terrorist attack happened in Quebec, in which one man killed six people and injured another five in a Quebec mosque on Sunday. Click <a href="http://www.torontosun.com/2017/01/29/4-reported-dead-in-shooting-at-quebec-city-mosque">here</a> to know more.</p>

<p><a href="http://pm.gc.ca/eng/news/2017/01/29/statement-prime-minister-canada-fatal-shooting-city-quebec">Here</a> is the statement by the Prime Minister of Canada on Sunday.</p>

<pre><code>Diversity is our strength, and religious tolerance is a value that we, as Canadians, hold dear.
</code></pre>

<p>After Tuesday's class, I found UBC faculties and students got together on the square and express their feelings and ideas about the event. Slogans such as "Hate is not the answer!" "LOVE" "Connection" were written on the posters. Several speakers were invited to give a public speech. More than one hundred audience circled around.</p>

<p>Well, these things were accidentally connected in my mind, which push me to think the goal of our education, the role of college in society, the beliefs behind our teaching practices.</p>

<h3>Wednesday</h3>

<p>On Wednesday, we visited the Richmond High School. Their students of grade 12 showed us around and introduced their school. Our college students also visited several classes and had a nice talk with their students.</p>

<h3>Thursday</h3>

<p>Teachers' professional development needs to be autonomous.<br/>
Teachers should make their classroom a more public place rather than a private place. Although new teacher may take their time to do so.</p>

<p>school system vs education agenda(教育系统与教育使命)</p>

<p>A history of my approach to teaching(Tony)</p>

<pre><code>As a beginning teacher. I believed in technical rationality.  
Graduate school. I encountered constructivism.  
More recently, I learned about complexity science  
</code></pre>

<p>Classroom as Complex systems: its not an entirely new idea!</p>

<p>Four theoretical principles of complex phenomena or system:<br/>
1 an emphasis on a non-linear frameworks(Davis, 2004)<br/>
2 cogintion is not simply representative of what we know but a continual bringing forth of what we know through the process of engagement(Capra,2002)<br/>
3 open system maintain themselves by being is a state of disquilibrium yet they remain stable nonetheless(Prigogne,1984)<br/>
4 spontaneous emergence of order from apparent random or unrelated events(2001)</p>

<p>What does your classroom look like？<br/>
* networks(peer, buddy, teacher, parents)<br/>
* self-regulation(negotiated curriculum)<br/>
* feedback loops(pairs, groups, whole class)<br/>
* disequilibrium(edge of chaos? generative)<br/>
* nested(student, class, program)</p>

<p>If a classroom or teaching and learning represent complex systems and if we fail to acknowledge them as such....
...then we are probably failing to allow for, recognize, or take advantage of the emergence of complexity as it arise in our practice.</p>

<p>Five features of complexity that enhance the possibility of emergence<br/>
Internal redundancy - commonality ...shared understantding<br/>
Internal diversity -variety ... a rich pool of ideas<br/>
Neighborhood interactions  -engagement ...ideas bumping up against one another<br/>
Decentralized control  -democratization ... collective authoring<br/>
Enabling constraints  playing field ...a generative space</p>

<p>Four implications for classroom:<br/>
1 surrendering certainty(open eye)<br/>
2 An emphasis on inquiry(the effort to articulate what we don't know)<br/>
3 Acknowledge Complicity(迭代交互影响)<br/>
4 Allow for improvisation</p>

<pre><code>I am not teaching you how to be a teacher  
but I am asking you think about being an educator in the world.(conception of teaching and learning; language to talk teaching &amp; learning; make sense of your practice as a teacher)  
</code></pre>

<p>Different perspectives：<br/>
1 Behaviorism(Behavior, Stimulus/Response)<br/>
2 Cognitivism(Symbols,making connections, schema)  <br/>
3 Constructivism(Elicit existing conceptions, personal construction)<br/>
4 Social Constructivism(Social interaction, mediation of knowledge)
5 Enactivisim(Embodied action, context is critical)<br/>
6 Complexity(dynamically adaptive phenomena, emergence)</p>

<p>Can you think of examples in your subject area</p>

<p>a test</p>

    <updated>2017-01-24T21:50:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://zhangchunlei.com/blog/2017/01/24/what-make-a-good-teacher</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post will not be another list of good teacher characters. There are already many lists. Some come from serious studies. Some come from just personal experiences or judge(like <a href="http://cgi.stanford.edu/~dept-ctl/tomprof/posting.php?ID=665">this one highly</a> recommended). Some come from student or teacher self-reports(read <a href="https://www.unicef.org/teachers/teacher/teacher.htm">this student self-report</a>). Well these lists of qualities of good teachers help little in explaining how teachers become good teachers. What I want to do here is think about the most critical character that make a teacher becoming a good teacher.</p>

<p>The best answer (I can give for now) is being serious of their teaching job is the most important character in becoming a good teacher. Being serious means the teacher really care about students' learning in class and take enough efforts to make it better. The efforts include making the place, understanding students, building connections, organizing cognitive burdens, trying different ways or strategies, critical thinking and examine their own practices, keeping learning themselves, making meanings and so on. Well, maybe it is cheating answer because it nearly included all the characters in the lists. But how can teachers become better if they don't care teaching at all.</p>

<p>The truth is that I care then I want to improve.</p>
