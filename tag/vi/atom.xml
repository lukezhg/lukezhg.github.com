    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Learning to use a new language is not easy. Learning to use all the shortcut keys of TMUX and VI also takes time.</p>

<p>Today, I want to record what I had learnt about TMUX and Vi.</p>

<p>While, I should divided this post into two posts, but TMUX only takes a little ink, so I just put it here.</p>

<p>TMUX is a tool to help you divide your screen of your terminals into several screens. Whenever you want to use hotkeys, you have to press Ctrl + B first, then you can press the hot key. You can change the pre hot key, but I just leave it unchanged. The most used keys are the following:<br/>
REMEMBER to press Ctrl+B first!!</p>

<pre><code>%  #divide screen left and right  
"  #divede screen up and down  
Ctrl + Down #make the down screen smaller  
exit #cancel present screen  
n  #new dash window  
</code></pre>

<p>That is it.</p>

<p>Then let me record the tips of VI. Well it is much complex than the former. Generally, it has three mode, i mode(insert and edit), v mode(copy and paste), and : mode(file operation). Ok let me write down the most used keys:</p>

<pre><code>Ctrl +: #this will let you enter the file operation mode  
i       #this will let you enter the edit mode, Press Esc to enter : mode  
v       #this will let you enter copy and paste mode, Press Esc to enter : mode  
</code></pre>

<p>When you press 'v' in the : mode, you can press Arrow Button to select the text you want to copy or delete, and then press:</p>

<pre><code>y       #copy  
d       #delete
p       #paste  
Ctrl+:  #show clipped board  
:%s/ski/sky/g  #replace ski with sky in all place  
</code></pre>

<p>Isn't easy. But it takes time to get used to them and operate unconsioucely.</p>

<p>I also want to keep down some hot keys of Ubuntu, let me google first. Ok here are they:</p>

<pre><code>Ctrl + Alt + L     lock the desktop  
Win                applications desktop  
Ctrl + Alt + Left  shift to left desktop  
Alt + Tab          shitt applications  
Alt + F4           shut down present application  
Ctrl+Win+Up        Maxilize present window  
Ctrl+Win+Down      Minilize presnet window  
Ctrl+Alt+T         Open terminal 
Ctrl+Shift+Arrow   Shift Workplace  
Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Arrow   move present window to Workplace  
</code></pre>
